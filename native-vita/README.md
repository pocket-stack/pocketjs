# PocketJS for PS Vita

`pocketjs-vita` is the native PS Vita host for PocketJS. It embeds QuickJS,
feeds the normal PocketJS pak, renders the standard DrawList with vita2d/GXM,
and reads the physical Vita controller. Applications do not need a
Vita-specific entry point, but their JS/pak pair is recompiled from the
resolved Vita plan so density and host-contract constants are target-correct.

The PocketJS logical viewport remains 480x272, so PSP applications keep the
same layout. The resolved Vita profile separately sets a 960x544 physical
viewport and raster density 2: geometry is sampled at physical resolution,
font coverage/SVG/core masks are baked at 2x, and `@2x` image or raw-pak
siblings are selected when present. There is no letterboxing or aspect-ratio
crop. Native Rust hosts can read the d-pad, face buttons, shoulders, and both
analog sticks through `input::read`. The stock PocketJS frame ABI deliberately
forwards buttons, the left stick, and front-panel contacts through
`Runtime::frame_with_input`; the public capability is `input.analog.left`.
The front panel is sampled once per frame and exposed to applications as stable
contact ids in 480x272 logical coordinates through `touches()` from
`@pocketjs/framework/input`.

## Toolchain

The supported local setup is:

- VitaSDK in `$VITASDK` (this workstation uses `~/vitasdk`)
- `cargo-vita` 0.2.2
- Rust nightly `2026-05-28` with `rust-src`
- Vita3K for emulator E2E

`scripts/vita.ts` prepends VitaSDK and the rustup shims to `PATH`, so a
Homebrew stable Rust installation cannot accidentally take over a Vita build.
The pinned toolchain is also recorded in `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```sh
export VITASDK="$HOME/vitasdk"
export PATH="$VITASDK/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

bun play vita hero
# builds, installs the hero's stable title id, and launches Vita3K
bun play vita gallery --fullscreen
# also enters host fullscreen and stretches the Vita display to fill it
bun play --help
# lists every demo accepted by the command

# Low-level build only:
bun run vita hero --release
# dist/vita/hero-main.vpk
```

`bun play vita <demo>` owns the interactive loop: it builds the selected demo,
validates and installs the VPK, safely restarts an existing Vita3K instance,
then checks that the new emulator process survives startup. In Vita3K, use the
arrow keys for the d-pad, `Q`/`E` for L/R, `C` for Circle, `X` for Cross, `V`
for Triangle, `Z` for Square, WASD/IJKL for the two sticks, and `F11` to toggle
fullscreen.

The VPK uses vita2d's precompiled shaders and does not require
`libshacccg.suprx`. Vita3K's normal interactive setup should still install the
official PS Vita firmware; the isolated homebrew E2E deliberately runs HLE
modules only so it cannot mutate a developer's normal VitaFS.

## Install on a PS Vita

Build the release VPK with the command above, then install it directly with
VitaShell; Vita Toolbox is not required:

1. Open VitaShell and press `SELECT` to start its configured USB or FTP
   connection.
2. Copy the named artifact, such as `dist/vita/hero-main.vpk`, to a writable
   location such as `ux0:/data/hero-main.vpk`.
3. Stop the transfer, select the VPK in VitaShell, press `X`, and confirm the
   install prompt.
4. Return to LiveArea and launch the demo's named bubble.

Each manifest's stable reverse-DNS `id` is encoded by the Vita backend as `P`
plus the first eight uppercase hexadecimal digits of its SHA-256 digest. This
produces a valid nine-character Vita title id without a per-demo table, so
Hero, Gallery, and other demos coexist instead of replacing one another. Keep
the manifest `id` unchanged across releases to preserve installation identity.
The VPK is self-contained; no separate app pak or shader file needs to be
copied beside it.

## Golden E2E

```sh
bun run e2e:vita
E2E_VITA3K_APP=hero bun run e2e:vita  # focused iteration
```

For each demo the driver builds a capture VPK, boots it in an isolated VitaFS,
waits for the guest `done` marker, and terminates only the spawned emulator.
It checks that every guest frame is exactly 960x544, was rasterized directly at
physical resolution, contains real detail inside at least one 2x2 logical
block, and is byte-identical to its independent `test/goldens-vita` image.
Vita3K's GXM framebuffer cannot currently be read
back coherently on macOS, so the pixel oracle is CPU-rendered; each capture also
asserts that every DrawList texture and font atlas used by the production GXM
pass is resident in its GPU cache. This catches backend-only omissions such as
core-generated rounded-corner textures or a font atlas rejected by the Vita
texture packer.

Current Vita3K 0.2.1 builds on macOS can fault while tearing down GXM after a
guest calls `sceKernelExitProcess`. Capture builds therefore park after the
`done` marker and let the host driver own process termination. Production VPKs
are unaffected.
