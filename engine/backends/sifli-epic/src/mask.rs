//! CPU construction of A8 coverage planes for glyph runs and alpha-only
//! textures. The formulas match the core rasterizer's coverage and sampling
//! so a hardware A8 blend reproduces the software result.
//!
//! A plane is addressed through a `window`: the target-local physical
//! rectangle whose top-left corner is byte 0 of the plane, `stride` bytes per
//! row. Executors may hand out planes smaller than the target, so callers
//! split large runs into windows that fit.
