# Pocket Vapor — design

**Pocket Vapor** (`@pocketjs/vapor`) is the ahead-of-time Vue compiler of the
Pocket family: you write a component in a **strict TypeScript subset of Vue
Vapor** — real `ref`/`computed` reactivity, real JSX templates — and the
compiler emits native code for machines that could never host a JavaScript
engine. The original proof target is the Game Boy Advance: 16.8 MHz
ARM7TDMI, 256 KB of work RAM, no OS, no allocator, no GC. The same compiler
now also targets the Game Boy, NES, an ESP32 MeowBit profile, and the
official Playdate Simulator; every build is still native C with a fixed
memory plan, not an embedded JavaScript runtime. The Playdate backend
currently produces a host-native Simulator bundle only, not a physical
device build.

Vue Vapor's thesis is *compile the virtual DOM away*. Pocket Vapor extends
it one machine layer down: **compile the JavaScript engine away.** The
component keeps Vue's authoring model and update semantics; the runtime that
ships is a few kilobytes of C — a dirty-bit scheduler, an arena, and a block
tree — not an interpreter.

## 1. Why not another DSL

Two prior Pocket experiments (`@pocketjs/aot`, then Pocket Static) compiled
games for retro consoles by carving TypeScript down to a bespoke DSL:
declaration builders plus generator scripts lowered to bytecode for a ~600
line stack VM. They work, but the author is always aware they are writing
the DSL, not the framework: no shared reactivity model, no component tree,
nothing transfers to or from real app code.

Pocket Vapor inverts the contract. The input is not a DSL that resembles
TypeScript; it is **Vue Vapor code that happens to obey a subset**. The
subset is enforced by the compiler with file:line errors, and membership has
an operational definition:

> Every Pocket Vapor component must also run, unmodified, under the real
> `@vue/runtime-vapor` on a JS host. The E2E suite executes both — the real
> Vue build as the oracle, the compiled ROM in an emulator — drives the same
> input script into each, and asserts the same rendered screen.

The Playdate backend is currently an explicit simulator-only extension of
that model: it shares the compiler, generated C, and logical-grid contract,
but local official-Simulator acceptance is not yet part of the automated
ROM parity matrix.

That is the MicroPython positioning: MicroPython is not a Python-flavored
DSL, it is a subset of Python with an implementation sized for
microcontrollers. Pocket Vapor is that, for Vue.

## 2. The one idea: reactivity as a compile-time artifact

A Vue component's reactive graph — which bindings read which refs — is
almost always statically evident in the source. Vapor already exploits this
shape at the template level; Pocket Vapor exploits it at the memory level.

The compiler builds the whole graph at build time:

- every `ref()` / `computed()` in setup becomes a **slot** in one statically
  sized state struct (no boxing, no heap);
- every dynamic template binding becomes an **effect function** in ROM;
- every dependency edge becomes a bit in a **subscriber bitmask** in ROM.

At runtime, writing `count.value = n` through a generated setter marks a
dirty bit and clears the validity bits of every computed whose (compile-time)
dependency mask includes that ref. Once per frame (Vue's batched-scheduler
semantics, with vblank as the microtask boundary) the flush runs each effect
whose mask intersects the dirty word; computeds recompute lazily through
generated accessors, exactly like Vue's `computed` — including inside event
handlers that read a computed between two mutations. Dependency *tracking* —
the expensive, allocating part of any reactive runtime — has no runtime
existence at all.

Where a dependency is conditional (`flag.value ? a.value : b.value`), the
compiler over-approximates: the effect subscribes to all refs it *may* read.
An over-approximated effect can only re-run redundantly — it renders the
same value it would have — so Vue's observable semantics are preserved; the
graph is a superset, never a subset. This is the one deliberate divergence
from Vue's dynamic dependency collection, and the E2E oracle keeps it
honest.

## 3. Memory: arenas, not GC

The runtime never calls `malloc` and never frees:

- **Static plan** — refs, computed caches, effect tables: fixed-size, laid
  out by the compiler. The compiler prints the memory plan (bytes of state,
  bytes of ROM tables) as part of the build.
- **Typed pools as arenas** — a `ref<T[]>` compiles to a fixed-capacity
  contiguous pool of inline `T` records; `push`/`splice` become pool ops
  (append / shift-down), and string fields are bounded byte arrays living
  inside their record. Exceeding a budget drops the operation and raises a
  tripwire flag the debug block exposes — never UB.
- **Bounded strings** — a `ref<string>` is a `{len, bytes[24]}` slot;
  string expressions build into stack scratch and assign through a
  change-compare (Vue's `Object.is` set gate, by value).

Nothing is ever collected because nothing is ever untracked: object shapes
are closed (the TS subset forbids dynamic keys), so lifetime is the pool
slot's lifetime. This is the "arena instead of GC" bet: for the UI workloads
these devices run, *ownership is structural* — state lives exactly as long
as the component or the collection entry that declares it.

## 4. The subset (v1)

Enforced with diagnostics, not documentation. In:

- `ref<number>`, `ref<boolean>`, `ref<string>`, `ref<T[]>` of a closed
  interface `T` with number/boolean/string fields; `computed<...>` of pure
  expressions over those — yielding a number, a **list view**
  (filter/slice chains), or a **record reference** (`filtered.value[i]`,
  compiled to a cached nullable pointer).
- **UI components**: module-level `function Name(props: {...}) { return
  <row .../> }` — genuine vapor functional components under the oracle,
  **inlined at compile time** by Pocket Vapor: each use site substitutes
  `props.<name>` with the use-site expression at the AST level, so const
  folding, dependency masks and row-span analysis all see through — six
  components in the demo add zero effects, zero RAM and zero calls. One
  root `<row>` per component, no nesting (v1), and prop names must not
  collide with row attributes (`y`/`x`/`pal`): vue's functional-component
  fallthrough only forwards class/style/on* while suppressing the
  template's own root binding of a same-named key, so a colliding prop
  would be written by nobody — the compiler rejects it with that
  explanation (use `line` for the row position).
- **Keymaps**: a setup const of shape `{ [Button.X]: action, ... }` where
  actions are zero-arg arrows or setup functions. Compiles to a 10-entry
  function-pointer table in ROM; dispatch is the one-liner
  `(cond ? mapA : mapB)[b]?.()` (missing entries are null pointers, `?.()`
  is the null check).
- **Setup helpers with parameters**: `function moveCursor(d: number)` —
  compiled to real C functions with `s32` params (annotation required);
  callable from actions, handlers, and each other.
- **Const objects** (`const PAL = { title: 1, ... }`) fold at member
  access; const string/string[] fold `.length` and index.
- **Whole-list assignment**: `todos.value = todos.value.filter(...)` —
  views over one list always carry increasing pool indices, so the
  compiler emits an in-place compaction; new-array identity always
  triggers, matching Vue.
- Sugar: `+=`-family compound assignment (numbers and strings), `++`/`--`
  statements, negative `slice` ends.
- Component = `setup()` returning a JSX render closure. One root component
  (v1: no props, no child components — the block machinery supports them,
  the demo doesn't need them).
- JSX: the Pocket host vocabulary (§5) with text interpolation
  `{expr}`, conditional attributes, list rendering via `.map()` over a
  `ref<T[]>` (compiled to a keyed list block), event handlers referencing
  setup-scope functions.
- Statements in setup functions: `let/const`, assignment and compound
  assignment, `if/else`, `for`/`while`, early `return`; expressions:
  arithmetic/comparison/logical ops, template literals, method subset on
  arrays (`push`, `splice`, `filter`, `map`, `find`, `length`) and strings
  (`slice`, `length`, concatenation).
- Numbers are 32-bit signed integers on the device. Fractional literals and
  `/` results are a compile error unless annotated — the demo needs none.

Out (compile errors): closures escaping setup, dynamic property access,
`any`, exceptions, async, classes, prototype anything, recursion in render,
`reactive()` deep proxies (v1 is `ref`-first; `reactive` is sugar the
compiler can add later).

## 4.5 Styling: the class DSL and the target style contract

Rows declare their look with the same Tailwind vocabulary the interpreted
framework compiles — `framework/compiler/tailwind.ts` owns the color table,
Pocket Vapor imports it, so `text-emerald-500` is one name across the whole
platform. The cell-grid subset:

    bg-<color>   text-<color>   align-left|center|right
    (colors: any tailwind name or bg-[#hex]; dynamic looks are ternaries
     of full class literals — the framework's constitution, reused)

Like everything in Pocket Vapor, styling compiles to data. Every distinct
(ink, paper) pair the app uses becomes an entry in the app's PAIR TABLE;
the pal byte in the cell grid is the pair id on every target. What an id
MEANS is the target's style contract:

| target | contract | lowering |
|---|---|---|
| web (oracle/dev host) | `web` | full color, CSS |
| gba | `rgb555`, <= 15 pairs | pair id = BG palette bank (BGR555 ink/paper) |
| gb, nes | `styles2` | pair -> glyph style by luminance polarity (dark-on-light / light-on-dark) |
| esp32 | `rgb565` | pair id -> RGB565 ink/paper values rasterized into the LCD cell |
| playdate | `styles2` | pair -> black-on-white or white-on-black 1-bit glyph style |

Diagnostics are compile-time and structured (`bun vapor/compiler/cli.ts
check <file>` prints the whole matrix in one run, no toolchains needed):

    VS101 unknown class            error
    VS102 unknown color            error
    VS103 palette budget exceeded  error (rgb555 targets)
    VS104 pairs collapse to one glyph style   warn -> error with --strict
    VS105 dynamic class not a ternary of literals   error

On oxc: considered and not adopted for the compiler. The checker needs the
reactive graph and the type environment the compiler already builds on the
TypeScript API — a second AST would buy parse speed we don't need (one
file, ~50 ms) at the cost of divergence. Where oxc could earn a place
later is editor-time linting: publishing the subset + class rules as an
oxlint plugin would give red squiggles without booting the compiler. The
`check` subcommand is the contract such a plugin would mirror.

## 5. Host vocabulary and rendering

Each target presents a fixed logical cell screen: 30×20 on GBA, 20×18 on
GB and ESP32, 22×18 on NES, and 50×30 in the Playdate Simulator. The ESP32
MeowBit profile rasterizes its 20×18 grid as 8×7 cells into a 160×126
content area on the 160×128 ST7735 panel. Playdate maps each 8×8 1-bit
glyph directly onto the Simulator's 400×240 framebuffer. The JSX vocabulary
is deliberately one intrinsic with two interpreters — the C cell grid on a
native target, and a ~60-line tree walker over the oracle's micro-DOM:

- `<row y={n} x={n} pal={p}>` — paints its text children at (x, y) in
  palette `p`, padded with spaces to the right edge; later rows overwrite
  earlier ones (document order).
- Children are string literals and `{expr}` interpolations (numbers,
  strings, chars, ternaries of literals).
- Lists are plain Vue: `{view.value.map((t, i) => <row y={BASE + i} …/>)}`.
  The compiler turns the whole map into one paint loop; the oracle lets
  vapor's own reactive block machinery re-render it.
- Conditional rows are plain Vue too: `{cond ? <row …/> : null}`.
- Looks come from the class DSL (§4.5); the painter and every runtime
  agree on pair ids, and the oracle asserts them as a per-cell grid.

Input is not DOM events: the host module exposes
`onButton((b: Button) => void)` (frame-latched edge triggering, GBA
KEYINPUT bit order). Under the oracle the module executes and the test tape
feeds it; under the compiler the import is recognized and the handler
compiles to a C function fed by the runtime's key-edge loop.

Playdate has D-pad plus A/B rather than Pocket's full ten-button vocabulary.
Its runtime sends D-pad edges directly, emits A/B for short presses on
release, maps a 500 ms A hold to START, and maps a 500 ms B hold to SELECT.
A completed hold suppresses the corresponding short press. The Todo app
already maps Right to the same filter action as R, so all of its actions
remain reachable without inventing a physical R button.

## 6. Pipeline

```

          │
          └─ vapor/compiler/compile.ts (Bun, TS compiler API)
               1 subset check      diagnostics with file:line
               2 setup analysis    refs/computeds/functions/handler → slots + C fns

               7 emit C            gen_app.c (state, computeds, effects, handler)
               8 cc + link         target toolchain + vapor/runtime/<target>/*
                                   → cartridge ROM, ESP32 firmware, or
                                     host-native Playdate Simulator .pdx
```

The fixed C contract (`vapor/runtime/vapor.h` plus `vapor_core.c`) is shared
by all apps. Each target supplies its hardware half: the console runtimes
own startup, video commit, input edges and a fixed debug block; the ESP32
runtime owns the ESP-IDF frame loop, ST7735 RGB565 raster, MeowBit GPIO
input and the UART receipt protocol; the Playdate runtime owns the official
Simulator update callback, 52-byte-stride 1-bit framebuffer commit, and
short/long-press translation.

## 7. E2E: the oracle is real Vue

`vapor/tests/`:

1. **Compiler unit tests** (`compiler.test.ts`) — subset diagnostics with
   file:line, deterministic C output, dependency-mask assertions on the
   reactive graph.
2. **Oracle tests** (`oracle.test.ts`) — the app's behavior pinned on real
   `vue@3.6` runtime-with-vapor over the micro-DOM: filters, toggles,
   editing, clamping, the empty state.
3. **Oracle ↔ ROM parity** (`parity.test.ts`) — one tape of button presses
   drives both the oracle and each console ROM; after every press the
   target's logical grid (chars *and* palettes) is compared cell-for-cell,
   read from the console runtime's fixed debug block.
4. **Oracle ↔ physical ESP32 parity** (`bun run vapor:esp32:verify`) — the
   verifier replays that interaction tape at 115200 baud and requests a
   logical-grid receipt after every press. This is an explicit opt-in
   hardware contract: `H` identifies the firmware, `R` resets in-process,
   `P <0..9>` dispatches a Pocket button, and `D` dumps character and
   palette grids. The source-derived build ID prevents an older compatible
   firmware from being mistaken for the current build. The receipt proves
   logical-grid parity and exercises LCD commits, but does not read panel
   pixels or electrically actuate GPIO buttons; those remain manual checks.
   Physical hardware is not part of the default emulator-only test suite.

Layers 3 and 4 state the claim of the whole project: same file, real Vue on
a JS engine, and native code on devices, compared for every step of the
interaction rather than only the final frame. The three console targets run
under automated emulators; ESP32 uses the same grid-receipt assertion when
a board is connected. Playdate is narrower in scope: manual local acceptance
builds with the official SDK's `make simulator` target and opens the
resulting `.pdx` in the official Simulator. It does not currently claim
automated per-press parity, an ARM device build, or physical Playdate
verification.

## 7.5 Targets

| | GBA | GB (DMG) | NES | ESP32 MeowBit | Playdate Simulator |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CPU | ARM7TDMI 16.8MHz | SM83 4.19MHz | 6502 1.79MHz | Xtensa LX6, up to 240MHz | macOS host |
| Toolchain | arm-none-eabi-gcc | sdcc + sdasgb + makebin + rgbfix | cc65/ca65/ld65 | ESP-IDF v6.0.2 | official Playdate C SDK + host clang |
| Grid | 30x20 | 20x18 | 22x18 (centered) | 20x18 on ST7735 160x128 | 50x30 on 400x240 |
| Palettes | 6 real BG banks | 2 glyph styles (BGP is global) | 2 glyph styles in CHR-ROM | RGB565 ink/paper pairs | 2 1-bit glyph styles |
| Pool / str caps | 32 / 24 | 32 / 24 | 8 / 20 (2 KB CPU RAM) | 32 / 24 | 32 / 24 |
| Image | flat ROM + header patch | ROM-only 32 KB | NROM-256 + CHR-ROM | ESP-IDF flash image | `.pdx` with host `pdex.dylib` |
| Debug receipt | EWRAM 0x2000000 | WRAM 0xD800 (grid IS the block) | $0200 fixed segment | UART 115200 (`H/R/P/D`) | startup console marker only |
| E2E transport | libmgba | libmgba | jsnes | physical USB serial (opt-in) | official Simulator (manual launch) |

The generated C is target-independent; geometry and budgets arrive as
`#define`s, `SCREEN.*` folds in the compiler, and each hardware runtime
implements the same `vapor.h` contract. 8-bit portability rules baked into
codegen: `s32`/`u32` are `long` on the 16-bit-`int` console toolchains, while
the Playdate Simulator uses `int32_t`/`uint32_t` because macOS `long` is
64-bit. Declarations hoist to function tops (cc65 is C89), variable-index
record access is u16 pointer arithmetic and bit masks come from a ROM table
(sdcc 4.6 SM83 miscompiles some u8-by-u8 multiplies — the __muluchar lesson
inherited from Pocket Static).

## 8. The demo — VAPOR TODO

`vapor/examples/todo/todo.tsx` — TodoMVC, Pocket-pad-idiomatic:

- List mode: ↑/↓ cursor, A toggle done, B delete, R cycles filter
  (ALL/ACTIVE/DONE — a `computed` filtered view), SELECT clears completed,
  START opens the editor.
- Edit mode: ←/→ scrub the glyph picker, A commits a glyph, B backspaces,
  START commits the todo (`todos.value.push(...)` into the pool).
- Header shows `{remaining.value} LEFT` (a `computed`); footer shows mode
  keys. Done rows render dim with a filled checkbox.

The ESP32 MeowBit exposes the six direct directions/action inputs used by
the app. Release-latched pairs provide the remaining Pocket buttons:
A+B = START, Left+Right = SELECT, and Up+Down = R.

In the Playdate Simulator, D-pad input is direct. Short A/B perform the
normal A/B actions; hold A for 500 ms for START (new/save), and hold B for
500 ms for SELECT (clear/cancel). Right cycles the filter in list mode.

State: 6 refs, 4 computeds (two of them list views), 4 span-merged paint
effects, a 32-entry todo pool. The compiler's memory plan for the whole app
is ~940 bytes of RAM; the GBA cartridge is under 9 KB, while the ESP32
artifact also includes the ESP-IDF platform image — which is the point of
keeping app state and generated C independent of the hardware envelope.

## 9. Out of scope v1 (explicit)

Components-with-props and slots (block machinery is shaped for them; not
demoed), `reactive()`/`watch()` sugar, floats/fixed-point, CJK text, sound,
saves, and unattended physical-device CI. Console parity remains
emulator-driven; ESP32 parity is available through the explicit
USB-connected verifier. Physical Playdate builds and hardware verification
are not claimed by the current Simulator-only target.
