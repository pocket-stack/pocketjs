# Determinism: the virtual clock, the effect shell, and the sim host

PocketJS's frame contract makes every app a pure fold over its inputs:

```
state[n+1] = F(state[n], input[n])
pixels[n]  = G(state[n])
```

One `frame(buttons)` call is one **transaction**: clock advance, effect
deliveries, app hooks, input edge-detection, Solid effects, sweep, then
`60/hz` core ticks. Nothing else can touch the world — no wall clock, no
microtask races, no mid-frame callbacks. Same tape in, same trajectory out,
byte for byte. This document covers the three pieces that make the fold
airtight and testable: the **virtual clock**, the **effect shell**, and the
**deterministic sim host**. `test/sim.test.ts` proves each claim in CI;
`scripts/flake-lab.ts` is the control experiment showing what happens to the
same app under a wall clock.

## The virtual clock (`@pocketjs/framework/clock`)

Time is the frame counter. The **simulation rate** — virtual frames per
second — is a *host policy*, not app code:

```
hardware refresh   PSP vblank / browser rAF / none (headless CI)   → pacing only
virtual rate (hz)  1..60, must divide 60                           → the world's clock
core ticks         60 per virtual second, exactly FIXED_DT each    → unchanged, byte-exact
```

A virtual frame at rate `hz` is one JS `frame()` transaction plus `60/hz`
core ticks. The core never changes: ms-based animations, transitions and
baked timelines cover the same **virtual time** at every rate — a 300 ms
tween is 300 ms at 60 Hz and 300 ms at 2 Hz, just sampled coarser.

Hosts publish the policy as `globalThis.__simHz` before the bundle evals
(web host: `?hz=2`; sim host: scenario option; PSP: always 60). Apps read
time through the clock API and stay hz-portable by expressing time in
seconds, never raw frame counts:

```ts
import { after, virtualNow, simulationHz } from "@pocketjs/framework/clock";

after(1.5, () => setPhase("menu")); // fires 1.5 VIRTUAL seconds out —
// frame 90 at 60 Hz, frame 3 at 2 Hz, the same instant of the same journey.
```

`after()` is the deterministic replacement for `setTimeout`: its deadline is
a frame index, its firing order is (deadline, insertion order), and it holds
no reference to the wall clock at all.

**The subsampling theorem** (proved per-frame in `test/sim.test.ts`): for an
app whose JS state changes only on events and virtual time (no per-frame
counters), the hz-world is not an approximation of the 60 Hz world — it *is*
the 60 Hz trajectory, strictly subsampled:

```
pixels_hz[m] == pixels_60[(60/hz)(m+1) - 1]     for every frame m
```

A 6.5-second journey is 390 observations at 60 Hz and 13 at 2 Hz — same
trajectory, same final screen, byte-equal. That is what makes the low-rate
world the natural habitat for agents and CI: ~30× less to record, replay,
and look at, with nothing semantic lost.

Frame-counted APIs (`onFrame` counters, sprite `frameStep`) are per-rate by
definition — an app that hard-codes "on frame 37" means something different
at each hz. That is a documented boundary, not a bug; write seconds.

## The effect shell (`@pocketjs/framework/effects`)

Buttons were already part of `input[n]`. The effect shell makes *everything
else* part of it too. An app never awaits a promise and never registers a
native callback:

```ts
import { runEffect, installEffectDriver } from "@pocketjs/framework/effects";

runEffect<Receipt>("order", { items }, (receipt) => setReceipt(receipt));
```

A command goes out; the result comes back as a **frame-boundary delivery** —
queued whenever the driver produces it, applied at the start of the next
virtual frame, before app hooks, FIFO. Deliveries are data in the frame
transaction, not scheduler weather. The API is callback-based on purpose:
promise resolution is timed by the microtask queue, which is a hidden input
owned by the JS scheduler — exactly what the shell exists to exclude.

Drivers do the real work, and are swappable per host:

- an app-installed driver (`installEffectDriver`) — e.g. the café demo's
  fake backend, which answers in *virtual seconds* via `after()`, making the
  whole app a closed deterministic system on every host including the PSP;
- a host-injected driver (`globalThis.__pocketEffectDriver`, wins) — how a
  harness takes over any bundle: replay a recorded effect tape, or
  deliberately deliver on wall-clock timers (`scripts/flake-lab.ts`).

A run's effect activity is observable through `globalThis.__pocketEffectTrace`
— every command and delivery with its frame index. That trace plus the input
tape is the complete causal record of a session.

## The sim host (`host-sim/sim.ts`)

A PocketJS host with no screen, no vblank, and no wall clock — it drives
virtual frames as fast as the CPU allows and records everything:

```ts
import { runScenario } from "./host-sim/sim.ts";

const trace = await runScenario({
  app: "cafe-main",
  hz: 2,                    // the 2 FPS agent world
  seconds: 6.5,             // 13 virtual frames
  script: [                 // input in virtual SECONDS — one journey, every rate
    { at: 1.0, press: BTN.CIRCLE },
    { at: 3.5, press: BTN.START },
  ],
});
trace.hashes;    // FNV-1a of the framebuffer after every frame
trace.effects;   // every command/delivery with its frame index
trace.tree;      // DevTools component tree after the final frame
trace.finalFrame // raw RGBA, for byte comparison across rates
```

Assertions are equality on traces. A "flake" is impossible by construction,
and `test/sim.test.ts` demonstrates it the hard way: chaos mode injects real
wall-clock sleeps, allocation churn and forced GC between frames — the trace
must not change by one bit (and doesn't).

The 60 Hz café journey (390 frames, full per-frame pixel hashing) replays in
well under a second — a 6.5-second user session, verified pixel-perfect,
faster than one frame of the real thing takes to show.

## The control experiment (`scripts/flake-lab.ts`)

One bundle, one journey, two clocks:

- **Runtime W** paces the same 60 Hz world with real `setTimeout` (rAF-style
  accumulator, timer jitter, occasional injected stalls) and delivers the
  order result on real wall-clock timers with network-like jitter. This is a
  normal day for a browser test — nothing exotic.
- **Runtime V** is the sim host.

Both measure the frame at which the order confirmation enters the world, and
a Playwright-style assertion ("confirmation visible by t=2.5 s"). W produces
a *distribution* of delivery frames and a partial assertion pass rate; V
produces one frame index, every run, forever. Same code. The only difference
is what "time" means.

## What this does NOT claim

- A 2 Hz run validates the 2 Hz world's semantics; it does not re-verify
  every per-frame detail of the 60 Hz world (the subsampling theorem covers
  shared points, not the frames in between — those are covered by running at
  60 Hz, which is just as deterministic).
- Determinism ends where an unrecorded input enters. A LIVE network driver
  is nondeterministic by nature — record its deliveries (frame + payload)
  and replay the tape; the *replay* is then exact. The shell is what makes
  that recording complete.
- `Math.random()`, `Date.now()` and friends are not fenced off by the
  runtime. The contract is: express randomness as seeded state and time as
  the virtual clock. The café demo needs neither.
