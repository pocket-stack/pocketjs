//! PCM output for the video plane (spec.ts STREAM audio ring): one NORMAL
//! hardware channel at 44.1 kHz fed by a dedicated thread from an in-RAM
//! SPSC ring, with a software integer upsample from the stream's rate.
//!
//! Why not the SRC channel: the first hardware session produced a constant
//! sizzle under the (audible) audio — the SRC resampler path is a known
//! quirk pit on real units. The normal channel at the PSP's native 44.1 kHz
//! takes the hardware resampler out of the loop entirely; a 22.05 kHz
//! stream is exactly a 2x linear interpolation, done here in microseconds
//! per block. The output buffer is dcache-written-back before every submit
//! so the hardware never reads stale lines (same class of bug as the
//! usbhostfs DMA constraint dbg::shot documents).
//!
//! Split of labor: the MAIN thread does all usbhostfs file IO (vid.rs tops
//! this ring up from the stream file inside videoTick's budget — two threads
//! on one USB pipe would contend) and the AUDIO thread only ever moves RAM
//! into `sceAudioOutputPannedBlocking`, which parks it in the kernel until
//! the hardware drains each block.
//!
//! Single writer (main thread) + single reader (audio thread) over absolute
//! frame counters; release/acquire pairs publish the PCM bytes with the
//! counter. `flush()` (seek/epoch change) is writer-side: it advances the
//! read cursor, and a racing reader at worst outputs one already-consumed
//! block — a click, not corruption. The CHANNEL is reserved AND released on
//! the main thread: releasing from the audio thread failed persistently on
//! hardware and leaked the channel (observed as "audio worked once, then
//! silence for every later session").
