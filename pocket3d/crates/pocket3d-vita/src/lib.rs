//! `pocket3d-vita` — a Pocket3D backend that composes inside a vita2d frame.
//!
//! The backend deliberately does not own `vita2d_start_drawing`,
//! `vita2d_end_drawing`, or buffer swaps. World geometry lives in GXM-mapped
//! memory and is drawn by the GPU with vita2d's precompiled shaders driven by
//! a perspective matrix, hardware clipping and the shared S8D24 depth buffer.
//! A caller can therefore render 3D, call [`end_3d`], and immediately submit
//! a PocketJS HUD before ending the same vita2d scene.
//!
//! The compatibility-oriented frame shape mirrors `pocket3d-gu`:
//! ```text
//! vita2d_start_drawing()
//!   pool.reset()
//!   pocket3d_vita::begin_3d(&camera)
//!   sky::draw(&mut pool, &camera, &sky)
//!   world.draw(&mut pool, &camera)
//!   mesh::draw_color_tris(&mut pool, actors, model)
//!   pocket3d_vita::end_3d()
//!   // PocketJS vita2d HUD submissions
//! vita2d_end_drawing()
//! ```
//!
//! Depth state hand-off: [`begin_3d`] enables less-equal testing with depth
//! writes; [`end_3d`] switches to an always-pass overlay configuration so
//! vita2d's stock z=0.5 HUD quads draw unconditionally on top.
