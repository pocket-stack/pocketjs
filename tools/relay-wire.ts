/** Provider-side relay wiring over an authenticated byte channel.
 *
 * The composed endpoint (`framework/src/relay/endpoint.ts`) is shared with
 * the guest: one object runs the L1 session, the P3 credit/queue machines
 * and the L2 authority. This file binds a provider endpoint to a duplex
 * byte transport:
 *
 *   bytes in  -> RelayRecordDecoder (split/coalesced records, bounded)
 *             -> RelayEndpoint.handleRecord (session, window, L2, credit)
 *   bytes out -> endpoint transport.trySend -> channel.send
 *
 * Authentication and encryption belong to the L0 transport profile
 * (draft §3.2 step 1); `serveRelayTcp` therefore takes an `authenticate`
 * callback that returns the peer identity and grants. The wire layer never
 * trusts identity claims inside HELLO metadata.
 *
 * Each physical connection gets a fresh endpoint: reconnect and guest
 * realm reset establish a new session with no carried-over
 * seq/credit/stream state. */
