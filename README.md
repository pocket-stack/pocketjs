PocketJS is a portable application runtime that turns modern component code into
native pixels across radically different hardware. Solid, Vue Vapor and Octane
components compile to one native tree, and a QuickJS guest drives a Rust core
that performs flexbox layout and draws every pixel **in one thread inside one
process**. There is **no DOM, no CSS engine and no WebView**.

## Programming model

### Frameworks

Three frameworks compile to the same native tree and run on the same QuickJS
guest. The choice changes application code and nothing below it.

| Framework | State and lifecycle | Source forms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Solid** | `solid-js` | JSX |
| **Vue Vapor** | `vue` | JSX and `<script setup>` single-file components |
| **Octane** | `octane` | Compiled hooks and JSX, with no virtual DOM |

Framework primitives are imported directly from `solid-js`, `vue`, or `octane`.
PocketJS owns the runtime, host components, lifecycle wiring, input, animation,
assets, and the native boundary.

```tsx
import { createSignal, Show } from "solid-js";
import { mount } from "@pocketjs/framework/solid";
import { Text, View } from "@pocketjs/framework/solid/components";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  return (
    <View class="w-full h-full flex-col items-center gap-4 p-4 bg-slate-50">
      <Text class="text-xl text-slate-950 font-bold">Count: {count()}</Text>
      <View
        class="px-4 py-2 rounded-xl shadow-md bg-blue-600 focus:bg-blue-500"
        focusable
        onPress={() => setCount(count() + 1)}
      >
        <Text class="text-base text-white font-bold">Press Circle</Text>
      </View>
      <Show when={count() > 3}>
        <Text class="text-sm text-emerald-600">Reactive on real hardware.</Text>
      </Show>
    </View>
  );
}

mount(() => <Counter />);
```

### Styling

Class literals are compiled into a baked style table at build time. The runtime
resolves a class attribute by lookup, so there is no CSS parser, cascade,
specificity resolution, or reflow on the device. The accepted vocabulary is a
fixed Tailwind subset, enumerated in
[Tailwind utilities](https://pocketjs.dev/docs/tailwind/).

### Animation

Keyframe timelines and spring curves are baked into the same style table and
advanced by the Rust core on its own clock, so a screen can animate **with no
per-frame JavaScript**. Motion Lab runs the yui540 studies in WebAssembly on
[pocketjs.dev](https://pocketjs.dev) and on the handheld they were written for.

### Target admission

One bundle serves machines of different densities. An application declares its
viewport and required APIs in `pocket.json`, and a target profile must satisfy
that declaration before compilation and packaging proceed. Run from the
application directory:

```sh
pocket check --target psp     # ok  480x272 · text.glyphs.baked · input.buttons
pocket check --target vita    # ok  same bundle, density 2, no component edited
```

## Rendering and execution

### From component to pixel

The guest emits tree mutations; the core owns layout, the style table, and the
draw list; a per-target backend submits that draw list through GE, GXM, Metal,
wgpu, software rasterization, e-ink updates, or another declared host.

```text
PocketJS · 1 thread, 1 process
  your component                        guest
  renderer adapter                      guest

  present                               gpu
  → pixels
```

### The frame contract

PocketJS makes time the frame counter. One `frame(buttons)` call is a
transaction that nothing outside it can interrupt, and nothing waits on a wall
clock, so tests run as fast as the CPU allows without changing the timing they
measure: a journey that takes six seconds in front of a user is a few dozen
frames in CI.

```text
state n+1 = F(state n, input n)
pixels n  = G(state n)
```

- **Effects land on frame boundaries.** A network reply that arrives partway
  through frame +3 is queued, not applied. It is delivered at the start of
  frame +4, in FIFO order, before any application hook runs. There are no
  microtask races and no mid-frame callbacks, and `after()` replaces
  `setTimeout` with a deadline measured in frames.
- **An async task lands on the same frame every run.** Driven by
  `requestAnimationFrame` against a wall clock, one awaited confirmation lands
  on **22 different frames** across 60 runs, and its timing assertion passes
  **9 times out of 60**. On the frame clock it lands on **frame 144 in every
  run**, 60 out of 60.
- **History is a data structure.** Tapes replay byte-for-byte, a session
  subsampled to 2 Hz is byte-identical to its 60 Hz counterpart, and forking a
  tape at frame 9 to splice in a different press produces a counterfactual
  world in **22 ms**.
- **Chaos mode verifies the floor**, injecting real sleeps, allocation churn and
  forced GC between frames without moving the trace by one bit.

## Performance

With no browser engine in the pipeline, the cost of a screen stays close to what
the hardware can do. A complete application drawing an animated interface
**occupies 8 MB on a single 333 MHz core**: a quarter of the PSP's 32 MB, one
part in 1536 of a 12 GB iPhone 17 Pro Max, on a core clocked 13 times slower
than an A19 Pro performance core at 4.26 GHz.

### On a Sony PSP

One MIPS core at 333 MHz, 32 MB of RAM, measured against the 16.67 ms budget for
60 fps:

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| OpenStrike frame budget | **2.2 ms** of JavaScript, 8.4 ms of total CPU work, worst observed frame 9.7 ms |
| Hero demo, cost of a virtual DOM | Solid 15.15 ms · Vue Vapor 16.74 ms · **Vue with a virtual DOM 90.75 ms** |
| Hero demo, the three shipped frameworks | Solid 3.66 ms · Vue Vapor 3.61 ms · Octane 6.53 ms |

Seven samples per application. The two hero-demo rows come from separate runs
with different toolchain versions, so each row is comparable internally but not
against the other.

### On a desktop

The same markdown editor shelled three ways on an Apple M3 Max
([full report](./docs/bench/gpui-vs-tauri-electron-2026-08-18.md), reproduced by
`bun tools/bench-desktop.ts`):

| | pocket | Tauri v2 | Electron |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Processes | **1** | 4 | 5 |
| Cold start to first painted frame | **149 ms** | 380 ms | 301 ms |
| Idle resident memory | **83 MB** | 193 MB | 382 MB |
| On disk | 10 MB | 9 MB | 242 MB |

With a document open and no input, the pocket build redraws **about twice a
second**: the caret blinking, and nothing else. The report also records where
the pocket build loses. Its storm CPU rises with document length, because the
editor re-wraps the whole document through the QuickJS interpreter on every
keystroke.

## Native modules

The runtime has a game engine's architecture, so a game and an application are
built the same way. Cores are **independent native modules, loaded the way a
kernel loads drivers**: an application takes the ones its content needs, and the
rest never enters the build. Mounting a module widens what the program may ask
for; it does not change how the program is written.

```text
guest program · JavaScript, one frame at a time
  ui       tree, layout, draw, input, focus
  net      poll batches
  audio    pcm mixer
  strike   bsp, bots, hits
  voxel    chunks, meshing
```

each row links to the post or pull request that brought it up. Keeping the
hardware bootable is its own work, tracked in Pocket Museum.

## Getting started

The zero-install path is the online
[Playground](https://pocketjs.dev/playground/). Local browser development
requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Rust via rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pocket-stack/pocketjs
cd pocketjs
bun install
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
bun run dev                    # build WASM + the Hero app, then serve the browser host
```

The CLI operates inside a PocketJS checkout:

```sh
npm install -g @pocketjs/cli
pocket doctor                  # report missing host and target tooling
pocket setup                   # install the pinned web + PSP toolchain
pocket create my-app
pocket check --target psp --manifest apps/my-app/pocket.json
pocket build --target psp --manifest apps/my-app/pocket.json -- --release
```

Vita packaging additionally requires VitaSDK and the pinned Rust toolchain
documented in [`hosts/vita/README.md`](./hosts/vita/README.md). Guest builds can
be packaged as inspectable, target-thinnable
[`.pocket` files](./docs/PLATFORM.md) instead of per-port directories.

## Ahead-of-time compilation

For machines that cannot host a JavaScript engine at all,
[Pocket Vapor](./vapor/README.md) compiles a strict Vue Vapor subset ahead of
time into target-native C: `.gba`, `.gb`, `.nes`, ESP32 firmware, and Playdate
`.pdx` artifacts, with no JS engine, GC, or allocator on the device. It is a
separate compiler with its own target and board contracts, not a low-memory mode
for arbitrary PocketJS applications.

```sh
bun run vapor:dev             # run the component against the real Vue oracle in a browser
bun run vapor:test            # oracle + compiler + console parity suites
bun vapor/compiler/cli.ts vapor/examples/todo/todo.tsx --target gb
```

Compiler-derived demands are checked against a target or board profile before
lowering; see [`vapor/DESIGN.md`](./vapor/DESIGN.md).

bun run golden                # deterministic WASM/web frame goldens
bun run e2e                   # PPSSPP journey
bun run e2e:vita              # Vita3K native-density journey
