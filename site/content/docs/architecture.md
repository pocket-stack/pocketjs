# Architecture

PocketJS turns component code into native pixels through
**one Rust core, framework-specific JS adapters, and one layout engine on every
host.**

`hosts/` holds one directory per host implementation — consoles, phones,
e-readers, a microcontroller, desktop, browser and a headless sim. A smaller
set of those ship as stock build targets, registered in
`contracts/spec/platforms.ts` (`POCKET_TARGETS`); the others build through
their own profile module or a supplied build plan. That registry is the only
record of what a target implements, so read it rather than any list
on this page — see [Platform contracts](/docs/platform-contracts/).

The JavaScript side can be Solid, Vue Vapor, or Octane. Solid uses its
universal renderer; Vue Vapor uses a Vapor renderer adapter and a DOM-shaped
facade for Vue's helpers; Octane compiles JSX and hooks to static host plans
plus dynamic slots whose driver (`renderer-octane.ts`) targets the native tree
with no DOM shim. The rendering, layout, styling, animation, and text engine is
one `no_std` Rust crate (`pocketjs-core`) compiled for each host's target
triple. Styling is a build-time [Tailwind subset](/docs/styling/); fonts are
baked into atlases at build time.

Reading it top to bottom:

1. **`app.tsx`** is ordinary framework JSX: PocketJS components from
   [`@pocketjs/framework/components`](/docs/components/), state/lifecycle from
   `solid-js`, `vue`, or `octane`, and `class` strings from the Tailwind subset.
2. A product **build** resolves `pocket.json` for one target, then runs the
   selected JSX transform, compiles class strings to a binary style table
   (`styles.bin`), bakes target-density glyph atlases/assets, and packs them
   into `app.pak`. The JS is bundled with target/ABI constants. The low-level
   `bun tools/build.ts <app>` path remains for framework development. See
   [Build pipeline](/docs/build-pipeline/) for the two-pass details.
3. At **runtime**, the selected framework runtime executes on whichever JS
   engine the host provides — QuickJS on the device hosts, the host engine in
   the browser or Bun — and emits mutation ops (`ui.*`) into `pocketjs-core`.
4. **`pocketjs-core`** owns the retained UI tree: it runs flexbox layout,
   ticks animations, measures and lays out text, and produces a flat
   **DrawList** each frame.
5. A thin **backend** turns the DrawList into pixels: sceGu/GE on PSP,
   vita2d/GXM on Vita, gpui on `hosts/desktop`, wgpu in the debug uihosts, and
   the deterministic software rasterizer in `engine/core/src/raster.rs` behind
   the browser canvas and the byte-exact PNG goldens.

Everything *above* the backend follows the same contract across targets. The
layout you see in the browser [playground](/playground/) is the same layout,
computed by the same code, that runs on the handheld.

ESP-IDF exposes the same stages as separate libraries — `pocketjs_guest`,
`pocketjs_ui_core`, `pocketjs_ui_qjs`, `pocketjs_render_rgb565`. **Only the
optional runner creates a task; the product BSP owns input, physical buffers,
and presentation.** See [ESP-IDF](/docs/esp-idf/).

## Why these choices

### Framework adapters over HostOps

PocketJS keeps framework code above a small renderer adapter boundary. Solid
uses `babel-preset-solid` with `generate: 'universal'`; Vue Vapor uses
`vue-jsx-vapor` and `renderer-vue-vapor.ts`; Octane uses its universal
compiler against the "pocket" renderer descriptor and `renderer-octane.ts`.
All three adapters target the same JS
mirror tree and `ui.*` HostOps, so the Rust core, input manager, style table,
animation system, `.pak` format, and native targets do not fork by framework.

The universal renderer means Solid never touches the DOM. Instead it calls a
small set of node operations (`createNode`, `insertBefore`, `setProperty`,
`replaceText`, …) that PocketJS maps onto the native `ui.*` contract. Solid's
distributed runtime references no `window`, `document`, `setTimeout`,
`WeakRef`, or `FinalizationRegistry`; it needs `Proxy`, `WeakMap`, `Promise`,
and `queueMicrotask`, and the last of those is polyfilled onto the promise job
queue.

### QuickJS reality: ES2023, minus timers

On the PSP the JavaScript engine is **QuickJS** (Bellard's engine, the
`2026-06-04` build), which is roughly **ES2023**. Modern syntax works — logical
assignment operators, `WeakRef`, and `FinalizationRegistry` are available.
PocketJS node lifetime does not depend on garbage-collector timing: the mirror
tree uses an explicit end-of-frame sweep plus `retain` / `release` for detached
subtrees.

What is *not* there shapes the API surface:

| Missing on QuickJS | Consequence |
|---|---|
| `queueMicrotask` | Polyfilled via `Promise.resolve().then(...)`; the host drains the promise job queue once per frame. |
| `setTimeout` / `clearTimeout` | `framework/src/scheduler-polyfill.ts` installs both where absent — `setTimeout` **lowers to a microtask and ignores its delay**, `clearTimeout` is a no-op. There is no wall-clock scheduling; use [`onFrame`](/docs/animation/) or `after()`. |
| `MessageChannel`, `performance` | Absent. Timing is frame-index based. |

That polyfill is the prelude for Vue Vapor (`framework/src/prelude.ts`) and is
itself Octane's prelude, because both runtimes' scheduler modules read the
globals at module evaluation time.

Because there is no timer or microtask *scheduler*, three Solid imports are
rejected by the compiler — `createResource`, `useTransition`, and
`startTransition` (`BANNED_SOLID_IMPORTS` in
`framework/compiler/jsx-plugin.ts`) — so a build fails rather than a device.
Browser and Bun development builds stay inside the same syntax and scheduler
subset. Target compatibility is checked separately from the manifest's required
APIs and viewport contract, so a touch-required Vita app is rejected for PSP
before compilation.

### taffy 0.11 for layout

Flexbox is computed by **taffy 0.11**, built with
`default-features = false` and the `alloc`, `taffy_tree`, `flexbox`, and
`content_size` features. That configuration is verified `no_std` + `alloc`,
f32-only, and needs no `libm`, which is exactly what a bare-metal PSP binary
requires. Using a real, tested layout engine — rather than a hand-rolled
subset — is why layout is identical on every host.

### One Rust core, compiled per host

`engine/core/` is a platform-agnostic `#![no_std]` + `alloc` library,
**`pocketjs-core`**. It contains no I/O, no graphics API, and no timing — just
the tree, layout, styling, animation, text, and DrawList generation. Each
directory under `hosts/` gives it a body: it compiles the same crate for its
target triple and supplies I/O, a JS engine, and a backend. `hosts/psp` embeds
QuickJS and renders through `sceGu`; `engine/wasm` wraps the identical core
with the software rasterizer in one `wasm32-unknown-unknown` cdylib that serves
both the browser dev host and the headless Bun goldens; `hosts/desktop` drives
gpui behind the `macos-app` and `linux-app` targets. Native hosts consume the
same stable `HostBuildInputs` projection.

### Native animation on a fixed core clock

Tweens and springs tick inside Rust in exact **`dt = 1/hz s`** steps. `hz` is a
per-realm declaration, not a constant: `engine/core/src/lib.rs` defaults to
`DEFAULT_TICK_HZ` 60 and caps at `MAX_TICK_HZ` 240, and `Ui::set_tick_rate`
is refused once the first `tick()` has run, so the rate is fixed for the whole
run. A bundle bakes its rate at build time (`--hz=N`, 1 through 240) and
refuses to mount on a host whose `ui.__tickHz` disagrees. One core tick per
virtual frame is the common case; a slower simulation rate advances several.
JavaScript only *declares* motion (through
[`@pocketjs/framework/animation`](/docs/animation/) or `transition-*` classes);
it never drives it frame by frame.

Given the same build, simulation-rate policy, input tape, and frame-boundary
effect deliveries, those discrete ticks follow the same trajectory. That is
what makes the PNG golden tests exact rather than fuzzy — the `wasm32`
rasterizer and the goldens agree down to the pixel.

### Baked text

The portable path carries no runtime font files. At build time an
`opentype.js`-based baker turns each glyph the app uses into a
horizontally-supersampled 8-bit coverage cell, plus proportional advances and a
cmap. On device, drawing text means run-length-extracting the alpha coverage
and batching it into GE sprites, with no glyph rasterization at runtime.
Because only the used glyphs are baked, the compiler scans your source for text
codepoints during the build — see [Styling](/docs/styling/) and
[Build pipeline](/docs/build-pipeline/).

The defaults in `framework/compiler/bake-font.ts` are **Inter** for regular and
bold and **JetBrains Mono** for the `font-mono` slots, chosen per slot at bake
time; `assets/fonts/` also vendors InterDisplay and W95FA, and each face can be
overridden per build. Two capabilities lift the baked-charset limit: a host
with `text.glyphs.runtime` extends the atlases at runtime for codepoints
outside the baked set, and one with `text.layout.native` measures and shapes
through the host text system instead, covering whatever the OS font fallback
chain covers.

## The three layers

PocketJS is three layers with narrow contracts between them.

**1. The app + framework runtime (JavaScript).** Your components and reactive
state. The Solid/Vue/Octane adapters keep a lightweight JS *mirror* of the tree —
`{ id, parent, children[], … }` — so the reconciler can *read* tree structure
without crossing the FFI boundary.
Only *mutations* cross into native. `setProperty` runs through a dispatch table:
`className` → style id, `on*` → the input registry, `src` → the texture
registry, a `style={{…}}` object → per-key property ids (previous-value
diffed). Anything unrecognized is a loud dev-time error rather than a silent
no-op.

**2. `pocketjs-core` (Rust, `no_std`).** The retained tree lives in a node arena
(`Vec<Node>` + free list) with a **generation counter**, so a stale handle is a
safe no-op rather than a dangling reference. Core parses the style table,
resolves `base` / `focus` / `active` variants, syncs nodes into taffy, measures
text, ticks animation tracks, and walks the tree into a DrawList. A CPU **clip
stage** in `draw.rs` guarantees no negative or oversized coordinates ever reach
a backend — axis-aligned quads are clipped with UV/color re-interpolation,
rotated quads are Sutherland–Hodgman-clipped or culled.

**3. The backend.** Consumes the DrawList and nothing else. PSP uses `sceGu`,
Vita uses vita2d/GXM, `hosts/desktop` uses the gpui backend
(`engine/backends/gpui`), the debug uihosts use wgpu, and `wasm32` uses a
scanline rasterizer that handles blending, gradients, and glyph coverage
deterministically. Backends do not redefine input or styling semantics, and
they differ from each other in one capability alone: **who measures and
shapes text**. An app that enhances with `text.layout.native` gets a core text
measurer installed before the guest mounts, so taffy leaf sizes, `measureText`
and painted glyphs all come from the host text system — layout changes with the
backend in that one case, and only for apps that asked for it. The rest are
byte-identical, which is what the PNG goldens pin. See
[Render backends](https://github.com/pocket-stack/pocketjs/blob/main/docs/BACKENDS.md).

The exact op signatures, node lifecycle, and per-frame ordering live on the
[Native contract](/docs/native-contract/) page.

### Modules beyond the UI

The UI is one module in that shape and the other domains reuse it unchanged. A
module is an SDK subpath, a spec, and a native core. Its capability id is the
same string as the spec namespace and the pak prefix: `audio.pcm` means
`globalThis.audio` is mounted and `audio:wav.` pak entries have meaning, so one
name covers the manifest, the runtime namespace, and the asset key.
`contracts/spec/` holds the shipped specs — `audio`, `db`, `fs`, `net`,
`platforms`, `spec`, plus the manifest, package, system and runtime-wire files.
They are plain TypeScript data: `gen-rust.ts` generates
`engine/core/src/spec.rs`, `gen-c.ts` generates
`contracts/generated/pocket_spec.h`, and `tests/contract.ts` regenerates both
in memory and byte-compares them against the committed files, so the three
languages cannot drift.

The guest has one clock, the tick. A module whose domain cannot wait for a
frame — real-time audio output is the shipped case — declares a native-side
clock in its frame contract: it never calls the guest, never blocks on it, and
batches its facts to tick boundaries for delivery. On virtual-clock hosts the
same module consumes by a pinned per-tick formula instead of a device callback,
so a two-clock module keeps a byte-reproducible headless test path.

## Repository layout

One axis per top-level directory. The tree and the rule that governs it live in
[`docs/STRUCTURE.md`](https://github.com/pocket-stack/pocketjs/blob/main/docs/STRUCTURE.md).

## Memory (PSP)

The PSP build replaces `rust-psp`'s default `#[global_allocator]`, which makes
one kernel object per allocation and caps out long before a real UI tree is
built, with one backed by a single arena (`hosts/psp/src/alloc.rs` over
`arena.rs`) — the same kernel block QuickJS, newlib and the core's textures and
retained buffers all draw from. The public **8 MB** figure names that
application arena with its safety headroom, not the PSP's whole main memory:
code and embedded `.pak`/JS bytes live in the EBOOT image, the worker stack is
separate, and display framebuffers come from VRAM. The allocator setup, the
per-frame vertex bump pool, and the exact PSP frame order are on the
[Native contract](/docs/native-contract/) page.
