# Pocket DevTools — time travel + inspection as framework primitives

PocketJS is a **closed, deterministic world**: the core ticks a fixed 1/60 s
step (`spec.FIXED_DT`), animation clocks count frames (never wall time), the
runtime bans schedulers/RNG/wall-clock, and the *entire* per-frame input is one
PSP button bitmask passed through `globalThis.frame(buttons)`. Frame content is
a pure function of frame index — that is already what byte-exact goldens rely
on.

DevTools turns that property into debugging capabilities that open-world
frameworks (browser, RN, Flutter) structurally cannot offer:

- **The input tape IS the app state.** Record one `u16` per frame (10 min ≈
  70 KB) and any session is reproducible byte-for-byte — on another host, on
  another build, in CI.
- **A bug report is executable.** `pak + tape + frame index` replays to the
  exact pixel; the same artifact becomes a regression test.
- **Inspection works on the real device.** The highlight overlay is emitted by
  the core into the DrawList, so every backend (sceGu on hardware, the wasm
  software rasterizer, wgpu) renders it for free.

## Layers

### 1. Core (Rust, spec ops 18–22)

New spec ops — added to `spec/spec.ts` `OP`, regenerated into
`core/src/spec.rs`, implemented on `Ui`, and exposed by both host bindings
(`native/src/ffi.rs`, `wasm/src/lib.rs`). All are **debug-only, default-off,
and unused by tests/goldens**, so shipped behavior is unchanged.

| op | JS (`ui.*`) | semantics |
|---|---|---|
| 18 | `debugInspect(id)` | set (0 = clear) the inspected node. During the next paint walk the core captures the node's **world AABB** (transforms, 3D-adjacent 2.5D path, scroll — whatever the walker composed) and appends a highlight overlay (translucent fill + 2 px edges, screen-space `RECT` ops) after all normal emission, on top, outside any scissor. |
| 19 | `debugRectXY() -> i32` | packed `x \| y<<16` (i16 halves) of the last captured world AABB; `-1` if none was painted. |
| 20 | `debugRectWH() -> i32` | packed `w \| h<<16` of the same AABB. |
| 21 | `debugPause(on)` | freeze the world: `Ui::tick()` becomes a no-op (frame counter, tracks, timelines, sprites all hold). `draw()` still runs, so the highlight stays live while paused. |
| 22 | `debugStep()` | arm exactly one tick while paused. |

Pause lives in the core because hosts call `tick()` unconditionally (the PSP
main loop is Rust; JS cannot intercept it). The JS shim gates its side (frame
hooks, input dispatch, tape) symmetrically, so a paused world is *fully*
quiescent and a step advances everything by exactly one frame.

### 2. Runtime shim (`src/devtools.ts`)

Compiled into every bundle (a few KB, zero-cost branches when disabled).
`mount()` wraps its frame handler through the shim:

```
poll transport → flush outbox → (paused? maybe step : record + run frame)
```

- **Flight recorder (always on, even with no transport):** every frame's mask
  goes into a `Uint16Array` ring (36 000 frames ≈ 10 min ≈ 72 KB). Any crash
  or "what just happened?" moment can be exported after the fact.
- **Component tree:** serialized from the existing JS mirror tree
  (`NodeMirror`), so reads never cross FFI. Semantic names come from
  (a) a `debugName` prop on any host component and (b) the `<Named
  name="MessageCard">` wrapper (tags the mirror nodes it renders) — both
  first-class framework API, exported from `@pocketjs/framework`.
  Mutation hooks in `native-tree.ts` mark the tree dirty; snapshots are
  throttled (≥ 30 frames apart) and sent only when dirty.
- **REPL:** `eval` runs in the app's global scope between frames — the world
  is quiescent there (microtasks drained), which is the honest granularity for
  a retained-mode UI. Results are safe-stringified (depth-capped).
- **Console bridge:** when a transport is up, `console.log/warn/error` mirror
  to the channel. On PSP — which has *no* console today (`src/prelude.ts`
  stubs it) — this is the first working `console.log` on hardware.
- **Errors:** exceptions thrown inside the frame are reported to the channel
  (with the current frame index — which, with the tape, makes them
  reproducible), then rethrown.

### 3. Transports

The shim needs only `{ send(line), recv() -> line | null }`:

- **Browser / desktop:** `host-web/engine.js` connects a WebSocket to the dev
  server (`/ws?role=device`) and injects the transport before the bundle
  evaluates. Latency: same-frame.
- **Real PSP over the PSPLINK USB cable:** a file mailbox on the usbhostfs
  share — the exact channel trace/bench already use. `native/src/dbg.rs`
  reads `host0:/pocketjs-dbg/in.jsonl` from a running offset and appends to
  `out.jsonl`; QuickJS sees `ui.__dbgPoll()` / `ui.__dbgSend()`. Enabled only
  if `host0:/pocketjs-dbg/enable` exists at boot (one failed `sceIoOpen` and
  the app never touches IO again — zero cost without PSPLINK). The shim polls
  every 10 frames on PSP (~166 ms hover latency; each poll is a few USB
  round-trips). `scripts/devtools-psp.ts` bridges the mailbox to the WS hub.
  The same mailbox works under the PPSSPP GUI via the `ms0:` fallback path.
- **Native desktop (macOS et al., `pocket-ui-wgpu`):** the same file mailbox,
  minus the USB cable — `pocket3d/crates/pocket-ui-wgpu/src/dbg.rs` is the
  std twin of the PSP transport. Probed once at `UiSurface::mount`: root =
  `$POCKETJS_DBG_DIR`, else the process cwd; active only if
  `pocketjs-dbg/enable` exists. Arm it with `bun run devtools --dir <root>`
  (an explicit `--dir` always beats a detected PSPLINK session), then launch
  the host from that cwd. Tree, highlight, pause/step, eval, and tapes work
  identically; `__dbgShot` is PSP-only for now (the panel's 📷 degrades to a
  warning).
- **Headless (tests, `scripts/tape.ts`):** an in-process queue pair. The CLI
  and the test suite are just DevTools clients — the whole protocol is
  drivable without a screen.

### 4. Protocol (JSON lines, panel ⇄ device via the hub)

Panel → device:
`{t:"inspect", id}` · `{t:"pause"}` · `{t:"resume"}` · `{t:"step"}` ·
`{t:"getTree"}` · `{t:"eval", id, code}` · `{t:"dumpTape"}` ·
`{t:"seek", frame}` / `{t:"replay", tape}` (handled by the *host*, not the
shim: the browser host reloads the demo and fast-forwards tick-only — no
render — to the target frame, then pauses).

Device → panel:
`{t:"hello", app, host, frame}` ·
`{t:"tree", frame, root:{i,t,n?,c?,x?,k:[…]}}` (id/type/name/class/text/kids) ·
`{t:"inspect", id, rect:[x,y,w,h]|null}` ·
`{t:"stats", frame, nodes, tapeLen, paused}` ·
`{t:"log", level, args}` · `{t:"error", frame, message, stack?}` ·
`{t:"evalResult", id, ok, value}` ·
`{t:"tape", tape:{v:1, app, frames, masks:[[mask,count],…]}}` (RLE).

The hub (`host-web/serve.ts`) is a dumb relay: device lines go to every panel,
panel lines to every device, plus join/leave notices. No state, no parsing.

### 5. Panel (`host-web/devtools.html`)

Component tree (hover → `inspect` → the region lights up **on the device
screen**, PSP included; click → pin + details: type, `debugName`, classes,
world rect) · pause/step/resume · tape strip (input activity per frame, click
→ seek on browser hosts) · record/export/import-replay · REPL with log/error
stream · 📷 on-demand screenshot (`{t:"screenshot"}` → browser hosts answer
with a canvas PNG; the PSP dumps raw VRAM to `pocketjs-dbg/shot.raw` +
`{t:"screenshotRaw"}`, and the bridge converts to the `{t:"screenshot",
frame, data}` the panel expects — pixels ride usbhostfs, not the JSON
channel). Served at `http://127.0.0.1:8130/devtools`.

### 6. One command (`bun run devtools [app]`)

`scripts/devtools.ts` owns the whole loop in one process: the dev server
(panel + hub), the mailbox bridge, and — given an app — the PSP session
itself (build the EBOOT, serve `host0:` over usbhostfs, `ldstart` via
pspsh). An already-running `bun psplink` / `bun run hw` session is detected
(pgrep + ps args) and bridged into instead of fought for the cable.
Shortcuts: `o` open panel · `r` rebuild + relaunch · `q` quit. Also exposed
as `pocket devtools` in @pocketjs/cli.

## The agent story (why this is core infrastructure)

An AI agent working on PocketJS cannot look at the screen or feel the d-pad.
Every capability here exists to make debugging questions *answerable from a
terminal*:

- `bun scripts/tape.ts replay <app> <tape> --hashes` — deterministic per-frame
  framebuffer hashes; `--png N` renders any frame to a PNG I can actually read.
- `bun scripts/tape.ts diff <app> <tape> --against hashes.json` — first
  divergent frame between two builds: a regression bisected to the exact frame
  *and* the exact input history that reaches it.
- `bun scripts/tape.ts tree <app> <tape> --at N` — the component tree as JSON
  at any frame, via the same protocol the panel uses.
- Tapes checked into `test/` become **session goldens**: real interaction
  sequences replayed against every future build.

## Breakpoint feasibility (assessed, deferred)

True line breakpoints in QuickJS on PSP require a bytecode-level debugger hook
(upstream QuickJS has none; the known patches — e.g. quickjs-debugger — add an
opcode-dispatch callback), a DAP-ish protocol on top of the mailbox, and
source maps through the two-pass Babel+Bun build (currently `sourcemap:none`).
All three are tractable (the mailbox transport built here would carry DAP
fine), but it's a multi-week vendored-interpreter change with per-opcode
overhead when armed. **Deferred.** What ships instead covers most UI
debugging at the honest granularity of a retained-mode framework:
frame-boundary pause (the world is quiescent between frames), single-step,
REPL eval over live state, tape time-travel, and console/error streaming from
hardware.

## Roadmap (designed for, not yet built)

I-frame memory snapshots (wasm linear-memory copies every N frames → O(1)
scrubbing; tape frames are the P-frames) · seek-on-PSP (multiple tick-only
steps per vblank ≈ 10× fast-forward) · tape-in-URL for the playground
(replays as shareable content) · causality index (pixel → DrawList op → node →
signal → input edge) · cross-device state teleport (PSP heap → browser wasm).
