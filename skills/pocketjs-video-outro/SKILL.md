# PocketJS Video Outro

## Overview

Turns any local video into a shareable clip that ends on the PocketJS brand card.
The card uses the current landing-page treatment: a dark `#171226` field, faint
blueprint grid, yellow/pink corner glows, the lens/viewfinder logo glyph, the
wordmark, and the uppercase VT323 headline. The default positioning is rendered on
three deliberate lines: `UI FOR` / `EVERY KIND OF` / `COMPUTER`. The exact VT323
font file is bundled with the skill, so card rendering does not depend on a network
font request. Headless Chrome renders the layers, then `ffmpeg` crossfades the
source into the card and animates the text in.

Design choices baked into the pipeline:

- **Crossfade first, text second.** The source dissolves into the *empty* branded
  background; the type only starts animating once the transition has settled, so it
  never fights the crossfade.
- **Staggered entrance.** Logo → tagline → URL, each fades in and eases up
  (~20-30px, ease-out cubic), ~0.35s apart, then holds.
- **Landing-page headline.** The positioning uses the same VT323 face, uppercase
  transform, `0.92` line height and `0.005em` tracking as the site hero. Preserve
  explicit line breaks instead of letting the browser choose the default lockup.
- **Audio is the source's, never synthesized.** The card is silent; the original
  track is preserved and gently faded out under the transition (no voiceover).
- **Shareable SDR output.** HLG/PQ phone footage is perceptually tone-mapped to
  BT.709 before compositing, and the browser-rendered sRGB card is converted into
  the same color space. This avoids mixing an SDR card directly into HDR code values.

## Requirements

- `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` on PATH. HDR inputs require FFmpeg 8+ for swscale's
  transfer/primaries conversion and perceptual tone mapping; SDR inputs do not.
- A Chromium-family browser (Google Chrome, Chromium, Edge, or Brave) — used only
  to screenshot the card layers. The script auto-detects it.

## Standard workflow

One Bun command produces the finished file (the driver is Bun TypeScript — this
repo keeps command wrappers in Bun, not shell scripts):

```bash
bun skills/pocketjs-video-outro/scripts/make-outro.ts -i ~/Downloads/clip.mov
# writes ~/Downloads/clip_outro.mp4  (H.264 high, yuv420p, +faststart, AAC 192k)
# default card: UI FOR / EVERY KIND OF / COMPUTER
# prints the output path on stdout; progress/summary on stderr
```

If the user supplies different positioning, preserve that copy exactly. Pass
explicit line breaks when the lockup requires them; the template keeps them:

```bash
bun skills/pocketjs-video-outro/scripts/make-outro.ts \
  -i ~/Downloads/clip.mov \
  --tagline $'UI runtime for\nevery kind of\ncomputer'
```

For an X upload, enable the compatibility mode. It produces 30 fps CFR video,
uses a conventional 30 kHz track timebase, closes GOPs, caps bitrate, and scales
landscape/portrait footage within 1920x1080 or 1080x1900:

```bash
bun skills/pocketjs-video-outro/scripts/make-outro.ts -i ~/Downloads/clip.mov --x
# writes ~/Downloads/clip_outro_x.mp4, leaving a standard outro export untouched
```

For X-mode verification, both reported rates must be `30/1`, the timebase must be
`1/30000`, and the dimensions must stay within the orientation-aware 1080p bounds:

```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 \
  -show_entries stream=width,height,r_frame_rate,avg_frame_rate,time_base \
  -of default=nw=1 ~/Downloads/clip_outro_x.mp4
```

Do not report a finished video from command success alone. Verify four independent
properties: full-file decode, delivery metadata, the visible card and its entrance,
and body-versus-tail audio. Choose a body sample that contains source sound.

```bash
OUTRO_VIDEO=~/Downloads/clip_outro.mp4
ffmpeg -v error -i "$OUTRO_VIDEO" -f null -                       # full decode
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 \
  -show_entries \
  stream=codec_name,profile,width,height,pix_fmt,r_frame_rate,avg_frame_rate,time_base,color_range,color_space,color_transfer,color_primaries \
  -of default=nw=1 "$OUTRO_VIDEO"
ffmpeg -v error -y -sseof -0.6 -i "$OUTRO_VIDEO" \
  -frames:v 1 /tmp/pocketjs-outro-final.png
ffmpeg -v error -y -sseof -6 -i "$OUTRO_VIDEO" \
  -vf 'fps=4/3,scale=480:-2,tile=4x2' -frames:v 1 /tmp/pocketjs-outro-motion.jpg
ffmpeg -hide_banner -ss 10 -t 5 -i "$OUTRO_VIDEO" \
  -af volumedetect -f null - 2>&1 | rg 'mean_volume|max_volume'
ffmpeg -hide_banner -sseof -2 -i "$OUTRO_VIDEO" \
  -af volumedetect -f null - 2>&1 | rg 'mean_volume|max_volume'
```

Inspect both images. The final frame must use the bundled VT323 face and show the
requested copy without clipping; the motion sheet must show a clean crossfade and
the logo → headline → URL stagger. HDR inputs must finish as `tv`, `yuv420p`, and
`bt709/bt709/bt709`. The body sample must retain audio and the final two seconds
must be effectively silent.

## Options

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `-i` / `--input` | — (required) | input video |
| `-o` / `--output` | `<input>_outro.mp4` next to input | output path (`_outro_x.mp4` with `--x`) |
| `--tagline` | `UI for` / `every kind of` / `computer` | hero line; explicit newlines are preserved |
| `--brand` | `PocketJS` | wordmark next to the glyph |
| `--url` | `pocketjs.dev` | footer line; pass `--url ""` to hide it |
| `--outro` | `5.5` | end-card length in seconds |
| `--xfade` | `0.8` | crossfade length; text entrance keys off it |
| `--crf` / `--preset` | `18` / `medium` | x264 quality/speed |
| `--x` / `--x-compatible` | off | emit an X-safe 30fps CFR social upload |

## How it adapts to the input

- Probes width/height/fps/duration; VFR inputs use `avg_frame_rate` rather than
  treating `r_frame_rate` as the real cadence. The selected rational rate is passed
  directly to FFmpeg, avoiding floating-point timebases.
- By default the card uses the source's native resolution and selected frame rate.
  `--x` switches to 30 fps CFR and orientation-aware 1920x1080/1080x1900 bounds.
- Display-matrix rotation is applied to the probed dimensions before rendering the
  card, matching FFmpeg's default autorotation for portrait phone footage.
- **Color:** SDR inputs keep the existing path. HLG and PQ inputs (including the
  HLG base layer in iPhone Dolby Vision clips) are tone-mapped to 8-bit BT.709 SDR;
  Dolby Vision metadata is intentionally not carried into the shareable H.264 file.
- **Type scales** with `scale = min(W,H)/1080`, so 720p, 1080p, and 4K all look
  proportional. The default headline keeps its three authored lines; custom copy
  preserves explicit newlines and still wraps before the frame edge.
- **Audio:** maps the source's *first* audio stream (`0:a:0`) and downmixes to
  stereo. This is deliberate — iPhone `.mov` captures carry an extra multi-channel
  spatial-audio track plus several data streams; `a:0` is the standard stereo mix.
  If the source has no audio, the output is video-only.

## Publishing a video on pocketjs.dev

There is no separate upload step — videos ship with the site deploy as
static Worker assets (Cloudflare, `site/wrangler.jsonc`; keep each file well
under the 25 MiB per-asset limit):

1. Commit the mp4 into git at `site/assets/<name>.mp4` (existing examples:
   `pocketjs-hardware-demo.mp4`, `pocketjs-demo-wall.mp4`).
2. Add a `copy(SITE + "assets/<name>.mp4", "assets/<name>.mp4")` line in
   `site/build.ts` step 4, next to the other mp4 copies. Files under
   `site/assets/blog/` (e.g. poster frames) are directory-copied
   automatically and need no explicit line.
3. Embed with a raw `<video>` tag in the page or post markdown. House
   classes: `class="w-full rounded-xl border border-line"`. Silent loops use
   `autoplay muted loop playsinline`; anything with a soundtrack must use
   `controls playsinline preload="metadata"` plus a `poster` (browsers block
   un-muted autoplay). Bake the poster with
   `ffmpeg -ss <t> -i in.mp4 -frames:v 1 -q:v 3 site/assets/blog/<name>-poster.jpg`.
4. Verify locally with `bun run site:build`, then merge to main —
   `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs `site:build` and
   `bunx wrangler deploy -c site/wrangler.jsonc`. Manual deploy is those same
   two commands.

## Customization & internals

- The card is `assets/outro.html`, parameterized via query string
  (`?layer=…&scale=…&brand=…&tagline=…&url=…`). Edit it to restyle; every dimension
  is in `rem` and the script sets root font-size to `10px * scale`. The landing
  headline face and its OFL licence are `assets/VT323-Regular.ttf` and
  `assets/OFL-VT323.txt`; keep the template local-font path intact.
- Entrance/animation is entirely in `ffmpeg`, orchestrated by `scripts/make-outro.ts`
  (Bun TypeScript, `import { $ } from "bun"`): each element is screenshotted as its
  **own transparent layer** with the *others kept in place via `visibility: hidden`*
  (so absolute positions never shift), then composited with per-layer `fade` (alpha)
  + `overlay` (ease-out slide). Change slide distances, stagger, or easing there.
- Keep new wrappers/tooling for this skill in Bun TypeScript — do not add `.sh`
  scripts (repo convention; see also `pocketjs-gba-imagegen`).
- To preview just the card without a video, screenshot the template directly:
  `"<chrome>" --headless --screenshot=card.png --window-size=1920,1080 "file://$PWD/skills/pocketjs-video-outro/assets/outro.html"`.

## Gotchas

- Chrome's headless screenshot honors `--force-device-scale-factor=1` and
  `--default-background-color=00000000`; the text layers rely on that alpha to
  composite. Don't drop those flags.
- Keep the output `yuv420p` + `+faststart` (already set) — some players choke on
  4:4:4 or non-faststart MP4s.
- `xfade` needs both sides normalized to identical size/fps/sar/pix_fmt; the graph
  does this. If you feed a variable-frame-rate capture, the `fps` filter conforms it.
- ReplayKit and other VFR captures can report a high `r_frame_rate` that represents
  their smallest frame interval, not their real cadence. Keep average-rate priority
  and the original rational expression when changing probe logic.
- Do not remove the explicit sRGB-to-BT.709 conversion from the card layers when
  changing HDR handling. Retagging Chrome's SDR PNG values as HLG/PQ is not a valid
  color conversion and makes the card shift on an HDR-aware display.
- The tagline on a very wide single line can approach the frame edge; it has
  `max-width: 92vw` and will wrap before overflowing.
