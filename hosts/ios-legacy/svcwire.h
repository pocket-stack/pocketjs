/*
 * SVC WIRE (PKNT) client transport for the legacy Apple hosts — the host
 * service channel (spec ops 30..32) over one TCP connection to a companion
 * process on the LAN, discovered through its UDP beacon (contracts/spec/
 * spec.ts "SVC WIRE protocol"; hosts/vita/src/net.rs is the threaded
 * reference, hosts/3ds/src/svcwire.c the frame-pumped one this file follows:
 * non-blocking BSD sockets, a bounded amount of work per frame, no threads).
 *
 * The guest contract is the PSP mailbox, unchanged: svcOpen is a
 * non-blocking probe the app retries, svcPoll drains complete JSON lines,
 * svcSend appends one line and is a silent no-op while disconnected.
 *
 * Compiled in only when POCKET_SVC_WIRE is defined (tools/ipodtouch4.ts does
 * that for apps whose companion lives on the network); every other legacy
 * Apple build keeps its op table byte-identical.
