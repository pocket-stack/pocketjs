# PocketJS iPod touch 4 host

This host targets the exact `iPod4,1` / iOS 6.1.6 / `10B500` hardware tuple.
It compiles the shared legacy UIKit runtime (`hosts/iphone2g/runtime.c`) for
ARMv7 and links it against the validated iPhone 4S sysroot — the same 6.1.3
ARMv7 shared-cache extraction, reused because the stubs are link-time only
and iOS 6.1.6 resolves the same install names. Apple system binaries are
never committed or included in the npm package.

The wrapper requires OpenGL ES 1.1. The retained UI core and UIKit view both
use density 2, and the host accepts only a 640×960 renderbuffer for the
320×480 logical surface. The runtime delivers up to eight touch contacts per
frame from its slot table; this device is the multi-touch acceptance hardware
for the legacy Apple hosts.

SpringBoard artwork reuses the classic PocketJS icon pipeline
(`tools/iphone-classic-icon.ts`).

Use `bun ipodtouch4 doctor`, then the build, deploy, launch, status, and
capture commands documented in `docs/IPODTOUCH4.md`.
