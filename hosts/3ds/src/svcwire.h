 * SVC WIRE (PKNT) client transport — the host service channel (spec ops
 * 30..32) over one TCP connection to a companion process on the tethered
 * machine, discovered through its UDP beacon (contracts/spec/spec.ts
 * "SVC WIRE protocol"; hosts/vita/src/net.rs is the reference
 * implementation, threaded — this one is the devserver.c shape instead:
 * non-blocking sockets pumped once per frame by the main thread).
 *
 * The guest contract is the PSP mailbox, unchanged: svcOpen is a
 * non-blocking probe the app retries, svcPoll drains complete JSON lines,
 * svcSend appends one line and is a silent no-op while disconnected.
