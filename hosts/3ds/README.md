# Nintendo 3DS host

PocketJS on the 3DS: QuickJS runs the guest bundle, the Rust core
owns the retained tree, layout, animation and DrawList emission, and a C
backend walks that DrawList into **PICA200 draw calls through citro3d**. The
app owns the **400x240 top screen** and a simultaneous **320x240 auxiliary
bottom screen**, both at rasterDensity 1 and presentation `native`, under the
out-of-registry `3ds-dev` profile in `tools/3ds-profile.ts`. The resistive
panel reports contacts through `input.touch.auxiliary`.

**The CIA boots and renders the calibration app on a New 3DS LL.** The profile
remains out of the production registry because the current hardware and golden
suite does not directly exercise the synthesized cursor, sprites, streamed
textures or a large font atlas.

`hosts/psp` puts its GPU backend in Rust because the `psp` crate has bindings
for the GE. citro3d is a C library of mostly `static inline` functions, so here
the split is the other way round and matches `hosts/iphone2g`: **C owns the
graphics API, Rust owns everything above it.** That is why this host's crate
exports the DrawList itself (`ui_draw`, `ui_draw_list_ptr`,
`ui_draw_list_len`) and the texture and font registries over the C ABI, which
`engine/symbian` does not — its GLES backends consume the list internally.

## Building

Two toolchains, one repository:

- The **Rust staticlib builds on macOS**. `armv6k-nintendo-3ds` is a built-in
  rustc target, so `core/.cargo/config.toml` only has to ask for `build-std`;
  `core/rust-toolchain.toml` pins the nightly. The target defaults to unwind,
  so the crate sets `panic = "abort"`.
- The **C half builds in the digest-pinned `devkitpro/devkitarm` image**, which brings
  `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, libctru, citro3d, `picasso`, `smdhtool` and `3dsxtool`.

`tools/3ds.ts` drives both and hands this Makefile container paths in
environment variables (the list is at the top of the Makefile). Nothing here
reaches outside `hosts/3ds` except through them.

```sh
bun tools/3ds.ts 3ds-demo              # dist/3ds/<output>.3dsx
bun tools/3ds.ts 3ds-demo --capture    # the deterministic e2e binary
bun tools/3ds.ts 3ds-demo --cia        # also dist/3ds/<output>.cia
bun tools/3ds.ts 3ds-demo --pocket-only # rebuild only dist/3ds/<output>.pocket
```

Every build writes a target-thinned `.pocket` next to the native artifact.
**The `.pocket` contains the admitted manifest, resolved plan, compiled JS and
target-flavoured PAK.** The native runtime embeds the same file as its immutable
recovery guest; it no longer embeds independent `app.js` and `app.pak` files.

## Updating the guest from SD

The runtime checks one staging path at boot:

```text
sdmc:/pocketjs/runtime/pending.pocket
```

With an FTP server running as a separate homebrew application, build and upload
the guest package, then exit the FTP server and start Pocket Runtime:

```sh
bun tools/3ds.ts 3ds-demo --pocket-only
curl --ftp-create-dirs -T dist/3ds/pocket3ds-demo-main.pocket \
  ftp://<device>/pocketjs/runtime/pending.pocket
```

The runtime verifies the package footer, exact `3ds-dev` target, host ABI,
identity, resolved plan and NUL-terminated JS section before it can boot. A
complete pending package is renamed to
`sdmc:/pocketjs/runtime/packages/<hash>.pocket`; package blobs are immutable.
An incomplete FTP upload stays at `pending.pocket` and does not replace the
running or accepted guest.

**A package becomes active only after its first submitted PICA command list has
retired successfully.** State is committed by appending a generation marker
under `sdmc:/pocketjs/runtime/state/`. Eval, frame or first-render failure loads
the previous active package, then last-good, then the embedded ROMFS recovery
package. Power loss before the generation marker leaves the previous generation
active.

`L+R+X` requests the same package check at a GPU-idle frame boundary. The full
chord is removed from the application's button mask. This supports an emulator
or direct SD writer; a separate 3DS ftpd cannot run concurrently with Pocket
Runtime.

Runtime receipts are written to:

```text
sdmc:/pocketjs/runtime/status.txt
sdmc:/pocketjs/runtime/last-error.txt
```

`status.txt` records the current generation, active hash, last-good hash,
running package hash and source path. `last-error.txt` records the failed phase
without deleting the rejected package blob.

## In-process development connection

`L+R+SELECT` opens the **3DS host's native development menu** on the bottom
screen. It shows the current IP and port, pairing or connection state, active
generation, running package hash, update and screenshot counts, and transport
errors. `X` requests a dual-screen screenshot from a connected client; `B` or
`START` closes the menu.

**While visible, the menu replaces the guest's bottom-screen DrawList with a
host-owned DrawList and consumes all guest input.** It uses the same verified
PICA200 backend as the guest and reads a fixed native Runtime snapshot; it is
not part of `globalThis.ui`, the guest input contract, or a published PocketJS
capability. The input latch stays active until the keys used to close the menu
have been released.

Pocket Runtime listens on TCP and UDP port 8131 when this file exists:

```text
sdmc:/pocketjs/runtime/dev.key
```

Pair once while ftpd is running, then restart Pocket Runtime:

```sh
bun run 3ds:dev pair --host <device-ip> --ftp-port 5000
```

**The pairing command generates a random 32-byte key, stores the local copy
under `.pocket/3ds/devices/`, uploads the device copy, and verifies the FTP
readback byte for byte.** The Runtime does not open a listener without the key,
and a client must prove the complete key before any command or package byte is
accepted.

**The key authenticates a client but does not encrypt the TCP stream.** Use the
listener on a trusted LAN, and pass `--rotate` to `pair` after a key is exposed.

After pairing, ftpd is not part of the development loop:

```sh
bun run 3ds:dev discover
bun run 3ds:dev push  --app 3ds-demo
bun run 3ds:dev probe
bun run 3ds:dev dev   --app 3ds-demo
```

**`discover`, `push`, `probe`, and `dev` do not require the 3DS IP.** The
Runtime answers one fixed-size UDP discovery request with its target, ABI,
TCP port, generation, active hash, and a stable ID derived from the pairing
key. The reply never contains the key. The desktop tool matches that ID to a
local key and then authenticates the TCP connection with the complete 32-byte
key. This keeps the pairing valid when DHCP changes the console's address.
Pass `--host <device-ip>` when broadcast discovery is unavailable; the native
menu supplies that address.

**`dev` waits when no paired Runtime is present, replaces a disconnected TCP
client, and rediscovers the same paired device ID until it reconnects.** Panel
commands and keyboard shortcuts are routed only to the current authenticated
client. A client that receives no PONG for eight seconds is replaced even when
the operating system has not reported the half-open TCP socket as closed. The
Runtime reserves the latest PONG until the bounded output queue can send it;
bulk screenshot traffic cannot discard the heartbeat response.

`push` builds and transfers the target-thinned `.pocket`, then waits for the
device's **accepted-after-retired-frame** receipt. `probe` requests runtime
status, native counters, the component tree, a live REPL evaluation, a console
message, and a combined top/bottom PNG. `dev` keeps the DevTools panel attached;
`r` rebuilds and pushes, `s` captures both screens, and `o` opens the panel.

**One authenticated, ordered TCP connection carries every development
message.** JSON frames contain only Pocket DevTools control and logs. Package
and rotated RGB8 screenshot bytes use bounded binary frames, so bulk data never
enters QuickJS or the application's capability surface. Uploads stream to
`network-upload.pocket`; the existing package admission, immutable blob,
GPU-idle cold-swap, acceptance, and rollback path remains the only route to an
active guest.

**The connection updates the guest `.pocket`, not the running `.3dsx` or CIA
host binary.** A native host or ABI change still requires deploying a new
`.3dsx`/CIA and restarting it; the embedded `.pocket` remains its final recovery
guest. Keeping that boundary lets ordinary app, asset and resolved-plan changes
use the in-process loop without letting a guest replace the process that admits
and rolls it back.

Two build-time facts are load-bearing:

- **`-DJS_NO_NAN_BOXING` must be on every translation unit that includes
  `quickjs.h`.** The header turns NaN boxing on by default for any 32-bit
  target, which makes `JSValue` 8 bytes instead of 16, while `libquickjs.a` is
  compiled with the flag. The mismatch links cleanly and then hands the library
  differently shaped values: the guest boots and QuickJS's GC walks garbage
  pointers a few hundred milliseconds later.
- **`__stacksize__` is raised to 1 MiB.** devkitPro's 3dsx crt0 gives the main
  thread 32 KiB, and QuickJS's interpreter plus the guest's render pass recurse
  far past that.

## The CIA, and the memory region it asks for

`--cia` writes `dist/3ds/<output>.cia` next to the `.3dsx`, from the same ELF
and the same staged romfs directory.

**A `.3dsx` runs under the Homebrew Launcher and lives inside hbmenu's memory
allocation. A CIA is its own installed title and asks the kernel for its own
memory region.** That request is `SystemMode: 64MB` in `app.rsf` — the largest
region an Old 3DS gives an application, out of the console's 128 MiB — plus
`SystemModeExt: 124MB`, which a New 3DS honours and an Old 3DS ignores. A guest
whose arena, expanded textures and pak add up past what hbmenu hands out has no
way to ask for more as a `.3dsx`. That is why the format is here: Pocket Voxel's
12 MiB arena plus ~14 MiB of expanded textures plus a 30.6 MiB pak is exactly
the budget that may not fit under the Homebrew Launcher on a real console.

Three facts about the packaging itself:

- **No banner is required.** makerom needs one only for a title that plays an
  animated banner in HOME Menu. The SMDH passed as `-icon` already carries the
  icon and the title strings, and `-exefslogo` supplies the boot logo.
- **The romfs is a directory, not an image.** makerom builds the romfs itself
  from `RomFs.RootPath`, pointed at the same directory 3dsxtool embeds. Handing
  it the raw romfs binary that `mkromfs3ds` produces — the container 3dsxtool
  takes — fails with `Invalid RomFS Binary`; the two packagers share the staged
  directory and nothing else.
- **makerom ships in neither devkitPro nor Homebrew**, so `tools/3ds.ts` fetches
  one pinned `github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR` revision into
  `dist/3ds/makerom/src`, builds it in the same container as everything else,
  and caches the binary against the container image and revision. mbedtls, blz
  and yaml are vendored in that repository, so the fetch is the only step that
  needs the network.

The title's identity comes from the resolved plan, never from a literal per app
(`ciaUniqueId`, `ciaProductCode`, `ciaProcessName` in `tools/3ds.ts`): the
**unique id is `0xFF000 | hash(app.id) & 0xFFF`**, inside the `0xFF000-0xFFFFF`
block that no retail or system title uses, so an app keeps one title id across
rebuilds and an install replaces its predecessor instead of accumulating. The
product code is `CTR-P-` plus four characters of the app id. The RSF's
`BasicInfo.Title` is the exheader's process name, which is 8 bytes — the cut
happens in TypeScript rather than silently inside makerom, and the title HOME
Menu shows is the SMDH's, still whole.

Azahar installs one and then boots the installed title from its own SD card:

```sh
azahar -i dist/3ds/pocket3ds-demo-main.cia
azahar "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Azahar/sdmc/Nintendo 3DS/\
00000000000000000000000000000000/00000000000000000000000000000000/\
title/00040000/0ffc1900/content/0429b6bc.app"
```

`00040000` is the application category and `0ffc1900` is this demo's unique id
shifted up by its 8-bit variation; `tools/3ds.ts` prints the whole title id when
it writes the file. A capture build installed and booted this way produced
frames **byte-identical to the `.3dsx` goldens** in `tests/goldens/3ds/`.

## What `globalThis.ui` has to publish

Beyond the HostOps table, `src/qjs.c` publishes four properties the framework
reads directly. `__host` and `__hostAbi` come from the build's `-D` defines and
gate mounting. `__textures` and `__sprites` are the pak name tables. The fourth
is geometry:

- **`ui.__viewport` is the logical UI size, and omitting it is a layout bug,
  not a missing nicety.** `framework/src/index.ts` sizes the mounted app and
  overlay layers from it and falls back to the spec screen, 480x272, when a
  host leaves it off. On this 400x240 panel that fallback lays the app out
  **80 px too wide**: the extra width is invisible for anything anchored left,
  and moves everything measured from the layer's right edge — `justify-between`,
  a row's last child after a `grow` sibling, every `right-0` absolute — off the
  panel. The value is read back from the core with `ui_viewport_width` /
  `ui_viewport_height` after `main.c` has called `ui_set_viewport`, so the JS
  root layer and the native root node cannot drift apart. Publishing a size is
  not a live-resize capability: that needs `installResizeViewportHook`, which a
  `takeover` host never calls.

## What the backend has to honour

`src/gfx.c` is the 3DS twin of `engine/symbian/src/gl/mod.rs`: the same walk,
the same texture and font-atlas caches, the same batching by texture and
scissor. It does **no clipping** — the core's CPU clip stage guarantees every
coordinate is already inside the viewport and i16-safe. The PICA200 adds:

- Render targets are created **rotated**: `C3D_RenderTargetCreate(240, 400, …)`
  for the top screen, and `Mtx_OrthoTilt` keeps guest coordinates landscape.
  `C3D_FrameDrawOn` resets the viewport, so `C3D_SetViewport` comes after it.
- **The scissor register is in raw framebuffer pixels and both of its axes run
  opposite to the logical ones**: the horizontal pair counts down from the
  logical height, the vertical pair from the logical width. Flipping only one
  of them mirrors the clip along the other axis, which stays invisible until
  the clipped content is not already the size of its window.
- Textures must be power-of-two, 8..1024 per side, and **already in the
  hardware's tiled layout** — 8x8 tiles row-major, Morton order inside a tile.
  `C3D_TexUpload` is a plain `memcpy`. Non-power-of-two images get a
  power-of-two envelope and their UVs are rescaled.
- **Tiled row 0 is sampled at v = 1**, so the source is flipped vertically
  while it is tiled and DrawList UVs then pass through unchanged.
- **RGBA8 texels are stored bytes A, B, G, R** — the reverse of the core's
  order.
- **Vertex buffers must live in `linearAlloc` memory** (`BufInfo_Add` rejects
  any pointer below physical `0x18000000`), and the arena is flushed out of the
  data cache before the draws that read it.
- There is **no fragment shader**: one TEV stage modulates the sampled texel by
  the vertex colour, and untextured ops bind an 8x8 white texture so that
  single stage covers every op. There is also **no paletted format**, so
  `PSM_T8` is expanded at upload.

## Capture and the Azahar loop

`-DPOCKETJS_CAPTURE` turns `main.c` into the e2e binary: input comes from a
tape baked into the binary rather than from the emulator's filesystem, the
frames in `[POCKETJS_CAP_START, POCKETJS_CAP_START + POCKETJS_CAP_N)` are read
back off the render target, and the process **parks instead of exiting** —
Azahar does not stop when the app returns from `main()`.

Emitted under `sdmc:/pocketjs-captures/`: `fNNNN.raw` named by the
process-global frame counter (exactly `400*240*4` bytes), then `done` written
only after the last frame is closed, and `error.txt` on the failure path so the
driver reports the message instead of a timeout.

The readback is **not** `gfxGetFramebuffer` after `C3D_FrameEnd` — that buffer
has already been swapped and reads back black. It is an explicit
`C3D_SyncDisplayTransfer` of the render target, after a vblank so the GPU has
finished. The bytes stay in the screen's rotated orientation, 240 wide by 400
tall, so the driver decodes `src[(x * 240 + (239 - y)) * 4]` into
`dst[y * 400 + x]` and reads the channels back as A, B, G, R.

**That transfer's output format is `GX_TRANSFER_FMT_RGB8`, and `main.c` widens
B, G, R into the A, B, G, R capture word itself.** Asking the transfer engine
for a 32-bit linear output out of this 240x400 tiled colour buffer returns rows
that are each individually correct and progressively misregistered — every
fourth output row slips a further 64 texels — while the same frame presents
perfectly on the screen. Azahar's software rasterizer answers the 32-bit request
correctly, so the wrong format is invisible until something renders through a
GPU: the identical build and the identical CIA both came back shredded under
Vulkan. Measured in the Pocket Voxel host against a known probe rectangle,
RGBA8 out matched 74.6% of it and RGB8 out matched 100.0%. RGB8 is also the
format citro3d's own presentation transfer uses, so the capture travels the path
the screen travels; the alpha byte it drops was never read, because the decode
takes R, G and B only.

```sh
bun tests/e2e/azahar.ts
```

**Azahar's two renderers agree on the picture but not on every byte.** With the
RGB8 readback in place, a Vulkan (`graphics_api=2`) capture of the demo differs
from the committed Software (`graphics_api=0`) goldens on **5.1% of pixels,
99.5% of them by 1 or 2 of 255** — the two rasterizers round texture filtering
and TEV blending differently — plus **24 pixels along the logo's one diagonal
edge**, by up to 157. A golden therefore still belongs to one backend, and the
e2e fixture pins it to Software, the backend that does not depend on the
developer's GPU driver. `E2E_AZAHAR_GRAPHICS_API=2 bun tests/e2e/azahar.ts`
re-measures the gap.

Azahar derives its whole user directory from `$HOME` and has no switch for any
part of it, so a run gets its own config and SD card by getting its own `$HOME`.

## Not advertised

`input.touch` is deliberately absent from the profile. The touchscreen belongs
to the **bottom auxiliary surface**, so it is exposed only as
`input.touch.auxiliary`; contacts are never remapped into the top screen's
coordinate space. `audio.pcm` is not implemented in v1.
