/*
 * Host-side input state for native hosts with a keyboard, a relative pointing
 * device (trackpad, trackball), and one tracked touch contact. Platform event
 * callbacks feed it through the functions below; the frame loop samples it
 * exactly once per guest turn. The module is plain C with no platform headers
 * so it compiles with the host compiler for the unit test in
 * tests/fixtures/pocket-input-test.c.
 *
 * Semantics the two BlackBerry Classic hosts share:
 *  - a key down produces one press edge (platform key repeats do not) and
 *    holds the button until the key goes up;
 *  - relative motion accumulates per axis; crossing the threshold emits one
 *    d-pad pulse in that direction and resets that axis;
 *  - the relative device's primary button is the press button (CIRCLE), with
 *    its own held state so it cannot release a key that holds the same bit;
 *  - one contact is tracked from its DOWN to its UP; other contacts are
 *    ignored; a contact that went down and up between two samples still
 *    reports exactly one down sample (the latch), and a release is reported
 *    at the very next sample.
