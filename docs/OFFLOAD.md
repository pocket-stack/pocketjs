# Offload

`io.offload` lets a single-threaded PocketJS guest submit bounded work to a
paired provider. **The guest does not receive a socket, filesystem handle, SQL
connection, or synchronous provider call.** The provider owns those resources.

This implementation is independent of `feat/companion` (#360). It adds
`@pocketjs/framework/offload`, a 3DS worker transport, and a Bun provider
transport. Pocket Folio is a separate application using the capability.

## Frame contract

| Boundary | Enforced limit |
| --- | --- |
| Wire record | 4,096 UTF-8 bytes, 4-byte big-endian length prefix |
| Request/result payload | 2,500 UTF-16 code units, serialized string |
| Outstanding guest requests | 8 |
| Native outgoing/incoming queues | 8 records each |
| Native submissions | 2 per host frame |
| Native result copies | 1 per host frame |
| JS completion callbacks | 1 per service-pump tick, including failures |
| Coverage resource | At most 512×16 pixels, one upload per host frame |
| Request deadline | 600 guest frames; provider worker deadline 9 seconds |

`submit` and `take` only copy fixed-size memory slots. **They do not call socket
functions, wait on locks, inspect the SD card, or run provider code.** The native
queues use single producer/single consumer ownership and acquire/release
atomics. Compilation requires lock-free 32-bit atomics. A full outgoing queue
returns false; a full incoming queue stops socket reads and lets TCP exert
backpressure. A connection generation fences both queues.

The service pump sends queued requests and delivers one completion before the
UI frame hooks. Deadlines, cancellation and disconnects release guest tickets.
**Sent requests are never automatically replayed.** A disconnected save can
have an unknown outcome. A provider mutation should use a durable operation
identity and a revision check if its caller needs retry after reconnect.

These limits remove IO waits from the UI thread. They are **not a hard real-time
guarantee for arbitrary JavaScript or rendering**. Application callbacks,
reconciliation, garbage collection, native allocations, GPU submission and OS
scheduling still cost time. Applications must keep their completion handlers
and visible trees bounded and measure the resulting device frames.

## Guest API

Declare `io.offload` in `engine.capabilities.requires`, then use:

```ts
import { offload } from "@pocketjs/framework/offload";

const work = offload();
const ticket = work.request("notes.page", "[0]", result => {
  if (result.ok) applyVisiblePage(JSON.parse(result.value));
  else showStatus(result.error);
});
// ticket === 0 means the caller retains the work because capacity is full.
// work.cancel(ticket) suppresses delivery; it does not undo provider work.
```

The realm owns one client. Applications do not step it themselves. Input is a
bounded string so the API never traverses an arbitrary application object to
serialize it. Providers return equally bounded strings. Pagination and resource
chunking belong to the capability contract, not to an unbounded accumulator in
the guest.

`uploadCoverage(base64, width, height, foreground)` uploads a bounded 2-bit alpha
mask when a host implements it. Width must be a multiple of four and at most
512; height is 1–16. Foreground is ABGR. The texture uses the next power-of-two
envelope, with a minimum dimension of eight. The 3DS decodes in C into reusable
scratch storage; a guest does not need a pixel expansion loop. Undefined means
unsupported; a negative handle means invalid input or exhausted frame credit.
The guest owns returned texture handles and releases them with `freeTexture`.

## Provider

`@pocketjs/framework/offload/provider` exports `connectOffloadProvider` and
`dispatchOffload`. The former owns TCP and a dedicated Worker for a connection;
the latter dispatches only own properties of an explicit method allowlist.
Worker initialization arrives as `{ init: data }`. Subsequent messages are
versioned requests. An over-budget response or malformed frame closes the
connection. A stalled worker is terminated instead of retaining its requests
indefinitely.

`@pocketjs/framework/offload/capabilities` exports two provider-side helpers:

- `sqliteQueries(db, queries)`: named, provider-owned SQL with device-supplied
  scalar parameters. Queries must return pages of at most 32 rows within the
  result-string budget. Never accept SQL source from the device.
- `httpResources(resources)`: named, fixed URLs. Requests reject redirects,
  time out after five seconds, and stop reading at 2,000 response bytes.

Install these helpers in the provider Worker. A file service can use the same
method allowlist while resolving opaque document IDs inside its granted root.
No document, Markdown, terminal, or platform SDK concept occurs in the guest
offload client or native queue.

## 3DS deployment

The current 3DS profile compiles a dedicated offload execution mode when the
resolved plan enables `io.offload`. **It boots its own embedded package and does
not run the SD package admission or development socket pumps during UI frames.**
It therefore cannot fall back to another application's shared active package.
Package replacement requires a new `.3dsx` and relaunch. L+R+START returns to HBL.

The worker listens on TCP 8741. Before framed traffic it requires the 64-byte
hex pairing key stored at
`sdmc:/pocketjs/offload/<first-16-hex-SHA256(app.id)>.key`. The Mac connects to
the selected device address. Pairing is scoped to the application. **This
transport assumes a trusted LAN: records and the pairing preface are not
encrypted.** It is not an Internet-facing transport.

Every two seconds the worker reports frame count, maximum measured CPU work,
and the count above 16,667 microseconds. CPU measurement includes JS, core draw
list generation, texture preparation and submission; it excludes the intentional
vblank wait. A frame-count delta also reveals lost presentation cadence.

The same request contract can use a provider on the device itself. That host
still needs a worker/process transport with enforced queues and resource
budgets; calling a local provider directly from JS would violate the contract.
**An iPhone-local provider backend is not implemented by this change.**

## Validation

Run `bun test tests/offload.test.ts tests/3ds-profile.test.ts` and compile/run
`tests/fixtures/offload-queue.c` with pthreads and address/undefined sanitizers.
The fixture exercises 100,000 full-size concurrent records, queue saturation,
counter wrap and coverage decoding. Tests also exercise fragmented UTF-8,
timeouts, cancellation, stale sessions, no mutation replay, provider grants,
SQLite result budgets, HTTP redirects and oversized bodies. These checks are
separate from device performance and interaction acceptance.
