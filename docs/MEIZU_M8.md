# Meizu M8 / M8SE

PocketJS runs on the original Meizu M8 as a Windows CE 6 ARM application. **The host embeds QuickJS and the Rust software renderer in one `PocketJS.exe`, then copies its native 480×720 BGRA framebuffer to the 480×720 LCD with GDI without stretching.** Host ABI 8 uses its wide touch-word format for the full native coordinate range.

**The PocketJS window is not system-topmost.** Pressing Home or Escape closes it so the Windows CE shell can regain the display.

The port targets the USB identity `0547:2720`, exposed by the phone as `MEIZU M8SE USB Serial`. **USB deployment uses the phone's WceUsbSh ActiveSync serial function, PPP, and RAPI; it does not flash firmware or modify a partition.**

## Build

Install Docker, Bun, Rustup, libusb, GLib, D-Bus, gettext, Autoconf, Automake, and libtool. **The native build uses the digest-pinned CeGCC container and a clean pinned QuickJS checkout; the Meizu SDK archive is not a build input.**

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun meizu-m8 doctor
bun meizu-m8 build
bun meizu-m8 setup-rapi
```

**The native compiler image, Rust nightly, QuickJS revision, SynCE revision, SDK checksum, USB endpoints, and device addresses are pinned.** `dist/meizu-m8/build-receipt.json` records the inputs and the resulting executable digest.

## USB connection and deployment

Enable USB synchronization on the phone and connect it directly with a data-capable mini-USB cable. Run `bun meizu-m8 usb-probe` only as a descriptor and handshake check; it consumes the current `CLIENT` handshake, so reconnect the cable before starting a full session.

The host-side USB bridge exposes a pseudo-terminal. Start it with `bun meizu-m8 usb-bridge` and keep that terminal open. Its first line is `PTY=/dev/ttysNNN`. In a second terminal, run `bun meizu-m8 session /dev/ttysNNN` with that exact path and approve the macOS administrator prompt. Then turn USB synchronization off and on without unplugging the cable.

The session command makes macOS `pppd` answer the phone's `CLIENT` message with `CLIENTSERVER` and negotiate `192.168.131.1:192.168.131.129`. It starts an isolated D-Bus instance, runs SynCE `dccm`, and registers the legacy ActiveSync device. Keep both terminals open while deploying.

```sh
bun meizu-m8 deploy
bun meizu-m8 status
bun meizu-m8 accept
bun meizu-m8 capture
```

`deploy` creates `\Program Files\PocketJS`, runs a helper that attempts to terminate only earlier `PocketJS.exe` and `PocketJS-*.exe` processes, and copies a build-ID-qualified executable. It derives the M8's 80×80 shell icon from the shipped iPhone 2G PocketJS icon, copies it under a build-ID-qualified path, and writes the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Meizu\MiniOneShell\Main\PocketJS` values required by the M8 SDK. The current build therefore appears as `PocketJS` in the phone's main shell without reusing a stale cached icon. **Status and framebuffer receipts use build-ID-qualified paths, so an earlier process cannot overwrite the current build's evidence.** `status` requires advancing guest frames, successful GDI composites, and the resolved 480×720 logical and physical viewports. `capture` retrieves the current build's device-generated framebuffer BMP from `\Temp` and rejects a frame that is not 480×720.

Tap the blue Hero control before running `accept`. **Acceptance requires `action_name=hero_tap`, a positive action value and sequence, and a completed touch sequence in the live device status.**
