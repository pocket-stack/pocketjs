# Prepared resources on 3DS storage

An app can install immutable images on its SD card and load them through
`@pocketjs/framework/resource-pack`. **File access and zlib decoding run on a
native worker.** Guest JavaScript submits an indexed address and receives a
bounded image ticket. It never opens a file, parses a directory or copies pixels.

```ts
const tiles = createPackedImageCollection(runtime, {
  key: (tile: Tile) => `${tile.version}/${tile.index}`,
  pack: tile => ({ name: `atlas-${tile.version}`, entry: tile.index }),
  width: 256, height: 256,
  maxEntries: 40, maxViews: 2, maxDemandsPerView: 24,
  fallback: { client: offload(), method: "map.tile", payload: JSON.stringify },
});
const visible = createResourceView(tiles, { demand: visibleTiles });
```

The collection owns one cache regardless of storage. Views merge demand,
priority and pins; withdrawal cancels delivery, completion releases staging,
and eviction frees the native texture. A missing or corrupt local record can
use the optional paired-desktop fallback. A host without `io.resource-pack`
uses that fallback directly. Loaders that report a disconnected client refuse
admission so they do not consume the shared scheduler's active slots.

Declare `io.resource-pack` in the app manifest's `enhances` list. The 3DS build
includes the worker only when the resolved profile enables this capability.
PSP and other hosts currently have no local pack implementation.

## Installation and image preparation

`tools/resource-pack.ts` exports `prepareTiledRGB565` and
`createResourcePack(path, count)`. The desktop converts core RGB565 pixels to
PICA's channel order, vertical origin and 8×8 Morton ordering, then compresses
each entry with zlib. The writer completes a temporary file before renaming it.
Install the resulting file at
`sdmc:/pocketjs/assets/<runtime-slot>/<name>.prp`. The slot is the first 16 hex
characters of SHA-256 of the app ID. Names contain 1–48 lowercase ASCII letters,
digits or hyphens. Upload to a temporary path and verify before activation;
installed names identify immutable contents and must change when contents change.

**A 256×256 prepared image occupies 128 KiB of GPU texture storage.** The host
copies its tiled RGB565 bytes without the normal RGBA8 expansion or pixel
conversion. The core retains a generation-tagged descriptor with dimensions,
without a second CPU pixel copy. The renderer adopts or retires storage only
after its previous GPU work completes. It performs at most one image/mesh
materialization per frame across the local and desktop paths.

The worker owns eight 128 KiB result slots, one 128 KiB + 128 byte compressed
scratch buffer, four open files and a 32 KiB thread stack. Zlib uses bounded
per-record working storage. **No whole atlas or whole index is loaded into
RAM.** A request reads one 24-byte index entry and its bounded payload.
Submission and delivery each allow one record per frame. Saturation rejects
admission; it does not wait. Realm reset fences obsolete jobs by generation.
Canceled reads may finish on the worker, but cannot reach the old view.

## Format and diagnostics

PRP1 version 1 uses a 64-byte little-endian header and up to 65,536 indexed
24-byte entries. Header fields are magic, version, count and total file length;
remaining bytes are zero. Entry fields are offset, compressed length, raw length,
CRC32, kind, then 16-bit width and height. Files are limited to 2 GiB minus one
byte for the 3DS stdio seek range. Every entry is independently zlib compressed.

Kind 1 carries at most 2,500 UTF-8 bytes of application metadata, with zero
dimensions. `resourcePacks()?.request("pack.read", "atlas/0", callback)` reads
it through the same bounded async service. The serialized response must fit
the 4,096-byte offload record envelope; excessive escaping produces an error.
Kind 2 carries tiled RGB565 images with power-of-two dimensions from 16 to 256.
CRC32 detects damage; it is not an authentication mechanism.

`resourcePackStats()` reports completed reads, failures, cumulative IO/decode/
upload microseconds and maxima. These counters separate SD and codec time from
GPU upload time; they do not measure full visible-tile latency or frame rate.
Compare identical camera routes and cache budgets on hardware before claiming
a latency or frame-rate improvement.
